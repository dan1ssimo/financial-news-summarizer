In that line of thought, here are 10 growth stock ideas for investors to consider. They range from a couple of high-profile household names, such as Tesla (TSLA -0.09%) and Delta Air Lines (DAL -0.76%), to companies like Navitas Semiconductor (NVTS 0.14%) and Synopsys (SNPS -0.71%), which are less well known.

You might want to consider buying and holding any (or all) of these equities long-term.

Tesla's robotaxis are a game-changer

The key to the investment case for Tesla lies in its promised robotaxis and unsupervised full self-driving (FSD) software, which is scheduled to launch on a limited basis beginning this week. Tesla is already a highly successful automaker and the dominant player in electric vehicles (EVs) in the U.S., and robotaxis offer the prospect of transforming it into a company able to generate high-margin and recurring revenue from owning its robotaxi fleet or revenue sharing from Tesla's transformed fleet using Full Self-Driving (FSD) software.

There's also the dedicated robotaxi, Cybercab, and the potential to sell FSD on a subscription basis. And all of it will be supported by Tesla's market-leading position in EVs and its ability to develop affordable EVs in the future.

Next-generation data centers

Nvidia partners Navitas Semiconductor and Vertiv (VRT -0.45%) and the next generation of data centers, namely 800-volt (V) high voltage direct current (HVDC), which I've discussed in more detail elsewhere, so investors with the time and inclination can peruse. Nvidia believes they will be more efficient, with lower maintenance costs and significantly lower costs of ownership.

The new data centers, scheduled for 2027, employ a different power conversion method, and Navitas is developing Gallium Nitride (GaN) and Silicon Carbide (SiC) power semiconductors to enable more efficient power conversion in 800V HVDC data centers.

Similarly, another Nvidia partner, and leading data center equipment provider, Vertiv, is developing critical power and cooling equipment and systems for the new data centers and expects to have them available in the second half of 2026, in time for the launch of the 800V HVDC data center in 2027.

What makes both companies particularly interesting is that, unlike their rivals, they are more like pure plays in their end markets. For example, Navitas specializes in GaN and SiC chips for power conversion (not silicon), and 80% of Vertiv's revenue comes from data centers.

Aehr Test Systems is opening up new end markets

Speaking of SiC and GaN chips, Aehr's (AEHR -3.13%) stock has soared recently on speculation that Navitas might be a customer for Aehr's testing and burn-in equipment. Aehr's equipment helps semiconductor manufacturers ensure quality and reliability throughout the manufacturing process.

Aehr has struggled recently as its revenue at SiC customers, including ON Semiconductor, has declined in light of pullbacks in EV investment. Still, Aehr is making good progress in opening up and winning customers in new markets, including GaN semiconductors and semiconductors for artificial intelligence (AI) processing.

Synopsys and the future of semiconductors

Synopsys is a leader in electronic design automation software (used to design and verify chips), and its intended acquisition of engineering simulation and analysis company Ansys is a key event. The aim is to create a company offering design software, as well as simulation and analysis software to test the fruits of the design. It will also open up Synopsys' solutions to Ansys' wider range of end-market customers, particularly as semiconductors and electronics are increasingly being embedded in a range of new industries.

Hexcel is the future of aerospace

The advanced materials company's lightweight composites are the future of the aerospace industry, as every new generation of airplane contains more composites. This means Hexcel (HXL 0.07%) can grow as airplane production increases (Airbus and Boeing have multiyear backlogs in place) and new, more composite-rich airplanes are developed.

Hexcel has faced headwinds in recent years as Airbus' and Boeing's delivery rates have fallen short of expectations, but it's only a matter of time before they improve.

Cognex's machine vision has long-term growth prospects

Cognex (CGNX -1.33%) is another company with excellent long-term secular growth prospects (the use of machine vision in automated processes) that has suffered near-term headwinds (weakness in key end markets like automotive and consumer electronics). Still, this is a temporary slowdown in a long-term growth story.

PTC, Trimble, and the growing interface between the digital and physical worlds

PTC (PTC 0.28%) provides computer-aided design (CAD), product lifecycle management (PLM), and other solutions essential to creating a so-called ""digital thread"" for a physical product as it moves from design through manufacturing, use, servicing, and ultimately disposal. As such, it's a leading player in the digitization of the industrial sector.

Trimble's (TRMB 0.18%) precise positioning hardware (its origins) and growing software/services also make it a leading play on digitization. In Trimble's case, it's about integrating physical positioning with the digital world, such as in construction and infrastructure work, transportation, and geospatial activities. Through the use of advanced analytics in the digital world, Trimble's solutions can be integrated into its customers' daily workflows.

ca.finance.yahoo.com,https://ca.finance.yahoo.com/news/tesla-tiptoes-long-promised-robotaxi-080320575.html?.tsrc=rss,"SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) -Elon Musk's vision of Tesla's future is set for a public test on Sunday, when a dozen or so self-driving cars in Austin, Texas start a limited, paid robotaxi service.

Though Tesla is dispensing with a webcast product launch event helmed by Musk, fans will be scouring the internet for videos and reports from the coterie of invited riders that will be allowed to hail the small stable of Model Y SUVs for trips within a limited area of the city, accompanied by a Tesla safety monitor in the front passenger seat. The driver's seat will be empty.

""Wow. We are going to ride in driverless Teslas in just a few days. On public roads,"" posted Omar Qazi, an X.com user with 635,200 followers who writes often about Tesla using the handle @WholeMarsBlog and received an invite.

The service in Austin will have other restrictions as well. Tesla plans to avoid bad weather, difficult intersections, and won't take anyone below the age of 18. Musk has said he is ready to delay the start for safety reasons, if needed.

Tesla is worth more than most of its biggest rivals combined, and Musk has said that is supported by the company's future ability to create robotaxis and humanoid robots. For years, he has promised self-driving cars were just around the corner.

Commercializing autonomous vehicles has been risky and expensive. GM's Cruise was shut down after a fatal accident and regulators are closely watching Tesla and its rivals, Alphabet's Waymo, which runs a paid robotaxi service in several U.S. cities, and Amazon's Zoox.

Tesla is also bucking the young industry's standard practice of relying on multiple technologies to read the road, using only cameras. That, says Musk, will be safe and much less expensive than lidar and radar systems added by rivals. Nonetheless, Musk says he is being ""super paranoid about safety"" with the rollout.

""So far, this launch lags significantly behind the company's promise and what competitors have already delivered,"" said technology researcher Forrester's principal analyst Paul Miller.

Fans have welcomed the caution and the long-awaited arrival. Qazi said on X, Tesla was launching ""extremely cautiously, which is good.""

www.fool.com,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/06/21/what-if-elon-musk-is-right-about-us-national-debt/?.tsrc=rss,"The highly public spat between Tesla CEO Elon Musk and President Donald Trump over the One, Big, Beautiful Bill highlights an ongoing, decades-long debate over national debt. The focus of this article is to explore a potential scenario and suggest a way to invest in protection against it.

That path is via life and retirement insurance companies like Prudential Financial (PRU 0.18%), MetLife (MET 0.84%), and Corebridge Financial (CRBG 0.18%). Here's why.

Rising debt, rising debt servicing payments

This chart gets to the heart of the matter. As shown below, the U.S. national debt has increased substantially, and so has the level of debt in relation to the country's gross domestic product (GDP). The shaded areas show recessionary periods, including the financial crisis of 2008-2009 and the pandemic, whereby GDP contracted and spending soared, so naturally, the debt-to-GDP ratio did, too.

Still, the response in both cases was the same: more spending and more debt.

Musk's view is that the national debt issue needs to be addressed as it's out of control and has the potential to saddle Americans with an unsustainable debt burden, which the bill will exacerbate. To be fair, the Trump administration's aim is not to increase the deficit as officials believe it will lower the deficit, through implementation of mandatory savings and promoting GDP growth.

Again, this is not the place to debate that matter. However, what if Musk is right and the U.S. continues down the path of rising debt?

Higher interest rates could be around the corner

Rising debt levels and debt servicing payments imply more debt issuance. Simple economics argues that, unless demand improves, the rising supply of debt will lead to a rise in the price of debt. In other words, long-term interest rates will rise, and could be higher than the market is expecting.

The chart below indicates that the market is comfortable with the matter and isn't attaching a significant premium (beyond the usual premium to reflect the increased risk of holding longer-dated debt) to long-term interest rates over medium-term rates.

But the market could be wrong. And while Musk's primary concern appears to be the difficulty of cutting rates caused by rising debt, it's only a short step away to argue that rising debt could lead to higher long-term interest rates.

Stocks to buy in a rising rate environment

The situation might not be catastrophic, but interest rates could be higher than anticipated. It's not an ideal scenario for stocks overall, as it makes them relatively expensive compared to bonds. However, there is one sector that could do well, namely life and retirement insurers such as Prudential Financial, MetLife, and Corebridge.

These insurance companies pick up premiums from policyholders. The policies create long-term liabilities for insurers that they need to balance against their assets. As such, they tend to invest in relatively low-risk assets, such as government debt. While rising interest rates will reduce the value of the existing debt holdings, they will also increase the discount rate used to calculate the net present value of their liabilities.

Consequently, as rates rise, insurers will be able to buy corporate bonds, mortgage loans, and government debt at higher rates. Here's a breakdown of all three insurers and the assets they hold in their general accounts, which are used to match their liabilities.

As indicated above, the assets in their general accounts are fixed income and relatively safe investments, giving all three companies good exposure to the theme of higher long-term rates.

Stocks to buy?

It's important not to be too alarmist here. The debt problem is undoubtedly an issue, but it's very hard to predict where interest rates, or total interest payable, will be. That said, if you are a young person worried about the public debt burden and the possibility of higher rates over your lifetime, then it makes sense to buy stocks in this sector as a form of (I'm avoiding the obvious word) matching your assets to your potential future liabilities from rising public debt servicing costs.",2025-06-21 20:10:00
www.fool.com,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/06/21/better-ev-stock-ford-vs-tesla/?.tsrc=rss,"-The comparison between Ford (NYSE: F) and Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA) is valuable and valid because it speaks to where the auto industry is headed and highlights the relative position of each company as it moves toward electric vehicles and robotaxis. Whether it's a legacy automaker (Ford) or a dedicated battery electric vehicle company(Tesla), the key opportunities and challenges are the same. So, which company is better placed to thrive in the future?

Affordable electric vehicles and robotaxis

Tesla's launch of its full-self-driving (FSD) robotaxi is sometimes seen as a tactical move as its electric vehicle (EV) sales and market share come under pressure in 2025, but nothing could be further from the truth. The reality is that major automakers, including Ford, and leading technology companies have invested billions in robotaxis and autonomous driving, and it's an integral part of the future of the auto industry.

The reason behind the investment is a recognition that robotaxis have huge profit potential, not least because they offer a long stream of recurring income from ride-per-mile revenue.

Another reality is that EVs are not cheap, and if they are the future of the auto industry, automakers need to make them more affordable. They also need to offer robotaxis to make mobility more affordable.

However, don't take my word for it. Here's Ford's CEO Jim Farley in 2019 on autonomous driving and robotaxis: ""The self-driving system is incredibly important to develop, but it's just one part of building a safe and scalable self-driving service that consumers can trust."" Farley went on to outline a timeline for a ""commercial self-driving service"" in 2021, which Ford would fail to achieve.

As for affordable EVs, last year, Farley reiterated the need to offer smaller and more affordable EVs to achieve profitability as an EV maker.

The two things are strongly connected. You can't have robotaxi EVs if the vehicles aren't affordable. That's a point that resonated during a recent CNBC interview with Waymo, which has a robotaxi service already in place, yet co-CEO Tekedra Mawakana declined to outline a timeline for the company's profitability. Waymo's lack of profitability means its owner, Alphabet, is going to have to invest significant sums, at a loss, if it wants Waymo to build scale. That creates a huge opportunity for a company like Tesla that is just entering the market and potentially offers a much more commercial and scalable service.

Tesla's advantage in scaling robotaxis lies in its ability to transform existing Tesla vehicles into robotaxis, as well as its capability to produce a dedicated robotaxi, the Cybercab. Unlike Waymo, Tesla doesn't need to partner with automakers to build scale. Moreover, Musk has disclosed that Tesla has been in discussions about licensing its FSD to other automakers -- another route to long-term profitability.

Affordable EVs

I'll cut to the chase. If Tesla can make automated driving and robotaxis work, then there's only one winner here, and it's Tesla.

First, Ford is a long way from having a profitable EV business. For example, its Model E segment lost $5.1 billion in 2024, and then $849 million in the first quarter of 2025. Ford sold 22,550 EVs in the first quarter, implying it lost almost $38,000 on every EV sold. Moreover, its EV models, the Mustang Mach-E, the F-150 Lightning, and the E-Transit, are far from being affordable EVs.

In contrast, Tesla generated $7.1 billion in operating profit in 2024. Despite losing market share amid declining sales, it still dominated the U.S. market, holding 43.5% of the market in the first quarter of 2025. Ford was a distant second with 7.7%.

Both Ford and Tesla are planning to release low-cost models in the future, but given Ford's ongoing losses, Tesla's profitability, and its ability to lower its average cost per car, down from above $38,000 in early 2023 to below $35,000 in late 2024, the latter looks far better positioned to do so sustainably.

Robotaxis and FSD

Ford backed off its robotaxi/FSD plans in 2022, following the shutdown of Argo AI by Ford and Volkswagen after years of heavy investment. The company had been created to develop the technology and received billions of dollars in investment from Ford and Volkswagen. For reference, General Motors has also ended robotaxi development.

In contrast, Tesla is preparing for the official launch of its unsupervised FSD/robotaxi service in Austin, Texas, this month, and it may be live by the time you read this article. While the launch will be small and highly contained, it still marks the birth of Tesla's robotaxi offering. Musk believes Tesla will have a dedicated, low-cost robotaxi, the Cybercab, in volume production by 2026.

Indeed, Ford may end up licensing FSD from Tesla, and to his great credit, Farley has indicated an openness to partnering on FSD.

Ford or Tesla?

There is no guarantee that Tesla's robotaxi or FSD will be successful, and investors need to closely monitor events. Moreover, Musk has a history of being overly optimistic on such matters.

That said, the major automakers have been and are still pursuing the idea of lower-cost EVs and robotaxis and automated driving, and currently, Tesla remains the best-positioned company to meet those aims. It's where the industry wants to be, and Tesla is in pole position.",2025-06-21 20:05:00

The recent announcement of Tesla's expansion into the Indian market is a significant development that could influence its broader growth narrative. Despite facing challenges in other regions, this move may provide a new revenue stream, potentially mitigating some of the pressures from decreasing sales in Europe and China. Over the past five years, Tesla's shares have seen a very large total return of 403.51%, illustrating substantial long-term growth. When comparing to the previous year, Tesla's share return also surpassed the market, which returned 10%, and the US Auto industry, which posted a 60.9% gain over the past year. This suggests persistent investor confidence in Tesla, supporting its trajectory even amid short-term volatility.

The strategic entry into a new market such as India might bolster revenue and earnings forecasts, as analysts anticipate a 16.6% annual revenue growth over the next three years. However, potential risks including geopolitical uncertainties and leadership changes could impact execution. With Tesla's current share price at US$275.35, it is trading close to the analyst consensus price target of US$289.44, suggesting a modest upside of 4.9%. This share price movement reflects mixed sentiments among investors regarding the balance of growth potential and inherent risks. Tesla's diverse initiatives, ranging from autonomous vehicles to energy solutions, underline its pursuit of long-term profitability, suggesting a complex interplay of factors influencing its market position.

With a stock price of just $2.22 (corresponding to a market cap of $6.77 billion), Lucid Group (LCID -1.35%) fits into this category. But the electric vehicle maker didn't get this cheap by accident. Let's dig deeper to see if it can overcome its operational challenges and generate massive wealth over the long term.

What went wrong for Lucid?

Looking at Lucid's stock price chart, it is clear that something went terribly wrong for the company. Shares have fallen by a whopping 96% from their all-time high of $58 (reached in early 2021), which means many early investors have been almost completely wiped out. The problem had a lot to do with macroeconomic factors outside management's control.

For starters, post-pandemic inflation caused the Federal Reserve to aggressively hike interest rates, making it harder for consumers to access credit to afford Lucid's high-priced sedans (the flagship Lucid Air starts at $71,400). Furthermore, EV demand began to slow as early adopters were reached and more competition entered the market.

Even the industry leader Tesla has faced pressure, with its automotive revenue dropping by 6% in 2024 -- before Elon Musk's overt political involvement made the situation even worse in 2025.

However, unlike Tesla, Lucid lacks the economies of scale to maintain profitability or keep losses under control, leading to spiraling cash burn. While first-quarter revenue grew by a respectable 36% year over year to $235 million, the company still burned through an eye-watering $692 million in just that quarter.

Lucid stays afloat through outside sources of capital, such as shareholder dilution (creating and selling more stock). But this has likely contributed to its underperformance.

Could Tesla's weakness be Lucid's strength?

Tesla's situation worsened in 2025, with first-quarter automotive sales dropping 20% year over year amid consumer boycotts and political backlash related to its CEO. This weakness could create an opportunity for Lucid to capture market share because it competes directly with Tesla's flagship Model S in the full-size luxury sedan segment.

This opportunity could be compounded by the possible passing of Trump's ""One Big, Beautiful Bill"" legislation, which aims to remove the $7,500 tax credit for EV purchases. According to CNN, the bill's current wording might exempt small players like Lucid, giving them a tremendous edge over their larger rivals -- although this legislation is still working its way through Congress, and nothing is finalized yet.

Trump's 25% tariff on foreign cars may also advantage Lucid by hurting imported luxury EVs from brands like Audi and Mercedes.

Is Lucid stock a buy?

Lucid definitely enjoys a lot of encouraging tailwinds from Tesla's political quagmire and Trump's trade and economic policies. That said, whether or not it turns into a millionaire-maker stock will probably depend on the rollout of its new SUV platform, Gravity, launched in late 2024.

Gravity is a make-or-break product for Lucid because SUVs tend to be more popular than sedans in the US. The vehicle likely contributed to Lucid's high top-line growth rate in the first quarter. And analysts seem optimistic that this trend can continue with a consensus estimate of Lucid hitting $1.4 billion in total revenue in 2025, which would represent a growth rate of 73.3%.",2025-06-21 14:00:00

Yeah, it's interesting. I've been in, I've been in Waymos and full self-driving Teslas and and, you know, the first thing that that jumped out to me was that the Tesla system felt more, more natural, right, in the process. Now, the, when you look at the Waymo system, and, you know, this is on the vehicles you see in San Francisco and other cities. Uh, or sounds like they're coming to New York at some point in the not too distant future. They have multiple redundancies in the system, right? They have cameras, they have LiDAR, they have radar and they, they because of those redundancies you know if people look at them and say there there's a higher level of safety. When you look at the, the Tesla system, you know, it's camera based and it's AI based, and they have massive quantities of data uh to do the analysis. Uh, to me the vehicles kind of felt a little more natural, but look but what we tell people is you know the lack of redundancies, the camera-based system only. There are some risks to that. Now, on the positive side, there's really three big benefits. Right, one is cost, right, if you're, if you're talking about a, a robotaxi which you're showing on the screen right now or whether we should talk about a Model Y that I that I subscribed to FSD with, you know the car can be $30 or $40,000. A a Waymo fully equipped with all the sensors, etc. is well north of a hundred thousand dollars. So cost is one. Second is uh, I think clearly the massive fleet of Teslas that are out there right now, which can become part of of a robotaxi fleet over time. But if I have a Tesla Model Y in the driveway and I have a you know full self-driving, you know theoretically I can drive that car to work and dump it into the robotaxi fleet. So the ability to scale based on a massive installed base uh is probably the second uh big positive. And, and then the third is their ability, I think, to have some flexibility whether it's uh, you know, some Tesla owned assets, assets owned by by individuals and even, even you know partnering with at some point or even using a you know me having a Tesla and dumping it into an Uber or or a Lyft fleet if I if I so choose.

With some promising companies still trading at significant discounts compared to previous highs, read on to see why two Motley Fool contributors think that Tesla (TSLA -0.09%) and Advanced Micro Devices (AMD 1.12%) stand out as smart long-term investment plays right now.

Tesla will suit enterprising investors willing to take on risk

Lee Samaha (Tesla): Tesla stock trades down about 22% in 2025 and down about 33% from its all-time high. It hasn't been an easy year for the company or its CEO, Elon Musk, with ongoing relatively high interest rates curtailing car sales overall, and Tesla appearing to lose some ground to its rival electric vehicle (EV) manufacturers. Meanwhile, Musk's political involvements have likely caused some brand damage, and the Cybertruck has proven to be a disappointment.

That said, there's an odd logic to the market's reaction to these events. The investment case for Tesla has never been purely based on it as an EV manufacturer. Instead, the main value in the company lies in its potential to generate a massive stream of long-term recurring revenue from robotaxis, possibly on a ride-per-mile basis, as well as selling unsupervised, full self-driving (FSD) software. The good news is Tesla plans to launch its robotaxi service, albeit on a small scale, in Austin, Texas, on June 22.

Naturally, Tesla's position as the leading EV company (and manufacturer of the best-selling vehicle in the world, the Model Y, and potentially the manufacturer of a low-cost dedicated robotaxi, the Cybercab) gives it a significant advantage in a market where competitors like Ford Motor Company and General Motors have unfulfilled ambitions. Indeed, there is a reason why leading automakers and technology companies have invested billions in developing commercially viable robotaxis.

Tesla is a speculative investment, with a significant portion of its stock price tied to the success of robotaxis and its FSD capabilities. It's a risky stock, not least because there are no guarantees surrounding its fledgling robotaxi service. However, if Tesla can demonstrate a successful launch of its robotaxi service, then there's plenty of upside potential for enterprising investors.

AMD could be ready to make waves in AI

Keith Noonan (Advanced Micro Devices): The artificial intelligence (AI) revolution is the most important trend in the tech industry. Thus far, Nvidia is the one company that stands out as the clear, undisputed champion in the AI hardware space. That looks like it could continue to be the case for the foreseeable future, but it doesn't mean that other players won't be able to score some significant victories in the category.

Like Nvidia, AMD is a designer of graphics processing units (GPUs) that can be used for training artificial intelligence models and running AI inference applications. Nvidia's GPUs are the clear-cut favorites among business customers seeking ultra-high-end performance, and AMD is currently a distant second place in the category. But crucially, there's a good chance that AMD's prospects in the AI space do not hinge entirely on unseating its rival when it comes to delivering bleeding-edge GPU and AI accelerator performance.

As the AI market continues to expand, there will likely be a market for a wider range of suitable hardware -- and AMD looks poised to score wins as this trend unfolds. Even better, the company delivered some great news for investors at its recent ""Advancing AI 2025"" conference. In addition to unveiling new advanced AI servers for the data center market, the company indicated that it's making some big leaps forward with its related software support systems. OpenAI announced that it will be using AMD's chips, and Amazon could also be moving to adopt the company's processors for its data centers.

In general, it looks like the market for AI GPUs and accelerators will be able to support more than one winner. While Nvidia is poised to retain leadership in the market, AMD appears to have solid second-place positioning -- and it could be in the early stages of benefiting from the broadening artificial intelligence hardware market. Despite a recent rally powered by excitement surrounding AMD's new AI chips, the company's share price is still down roughly 40% and looks like a smart buy.",2025-06-21 11:15:00

The humanoid robot arms race is on, and it’s not just Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) making noise with its Optimus humanoid—the real action is happening among a new generation of private players, each betting big on a future where humanoids are everywhere from factory floors to your living room, according to UBS analysts.

""Understanding what these private companies are working on and tracking their progress can help inform investors about the future/feasibility of the humanoid robot opportunity and use cases such as more plant automation,” UBS analysts said in a recent note, pointing to a wave of start-ups already landing deals with auto giants like BMW (ETR:BMWG) and Mercedes.

Figure AI: The unicorn out front

Figure AI, founded in 2022, is going all-in on autonomous humanoids for manufacturing, logistics, and retail. Figure’s BotQ facility can crank out up to 12,000 robots a year, and the company is already using its own robots to build more robots. After a $1.5 billion Series C in May 2025, Figure’s valuation soared to $39.5 billion, with its first commercial deal inked with BMW and a second, undisclosed “major US company” already signed. Between these two customers, Figure believes there’s a path to 100,000 robots over the next four years.

Agility robotics: real-world robots, real deployments

Agility Robotics, meanwhile, is already deploying its Digit robots in logistics and manufacturing, targeting the more than one million unfilled material handling jobs in the U.S. With partnerships ranging from GXO Logistics Inc (NYSE:GXO) and Schaeffler to Tompkins (NYSE:TMP) Solutions, Agility is scaling up quickly, pushing robots-as-a-service deals and using its Agility Arc platform to control robots in tandem with other equipment. The company recently upgraded Digit’s battery life and safety features, and a minority investment from Schaeffler signals growing industry confidence.

Collaborative Robotics: humans + robots, side by side

Collaborative Robotics, or Cobot, is taking a different approach, focusing on AI-driven collaborative robots that work shoulder-to-shoulder with people in shared workspaces such as warehouses, hospitals, and factories. Since their 2024 debut, Cobot’s Proxie robots have logged over 5,000 operational hours and moved 16,000 carts in customer facilities. The company is developing cobots that integrate large language models, voice recognition, and speech synthesis to enable dynamic, human-like interaction on the job

Apptronik: From nasa to mercedes

Apptronik, with roots in NASA, has built Apollo, a robot designed for heavy lifting in manufacturing, logistics, and even healthcare. Commercial deployments began with Mercedes-Benz (OTC:MBGAF) in 2024, and new partnerships with Jabil and Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL) DeepMind are helping scale both production and AI capabilities. Apollo is built to perform physically demanding tasks in industrial spaces, working right alongside humans

1x Technologies: home humanoids at scale

1X Technologies is targeting the home, planning large-scale deployment of its Neo humanoid in the U.S. in 2025. The company’s acquisition of Kind Humanoid is accelerating its tech development, and 1X is backed by EQT (ST:EQTAB) Ventures. Their focus is on creating an abundant supply of labor via safe, intelligent humanoids, scaling from research and development to full-scale manufacturing

Mentee robotics, skild ai, foundation robotics labs, plus one robotics: the next wave

The next wave of contenders is equally ambitious. Mentee Robotics is building robots that can be “mentored” in real time by humans, aiming for personalized, adaptive bots.

Skild AI is all about general-purpose robotic intelligence, boasting a $4.7 billion valuation and backing from Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and SoftBank (TYO:9984), with its sights set on construction, manufacturing, and security robots.

Foundation Robotics Labs is shipping robots for manufacturing, logistics, domestic, and defense use, with a goal of delivering over 10,000 units in 2026. Plus One Robotics, meanwhile, is the parcel-handling specialist, with over one billion picks and AI-powered warehouse automation already saving customers millions in labor costs.

While Tesla may be the face of the humanoid-enabled robot future, UBS suggest the real battleground is among these private upstarts—each racing toward a multi-billion-dollar reality, one robot at a time.

www.fool.com,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/06/21/where-will-tesla-be-in-10-years/?.tsrc=rss,"Tesla (TSLA -0.09%) is now one of the largest companies in the world, with a market cap of more than $1 trillion. Much of Tesla's valuation stems from its automaking business. Its Model Y and Model 3 vehicles are consistently some of the highest-selling EVs in the U.S. And with EV sales still representing less than 10% of total U.S. vehicle sales, significant growth is yet to come.

But Tesla's long-term future won't be dominated by making vehicles. In fact, over the next 10 years, there's a brand new business segment that could be worth more than $1 trillion on its own.

Expect robotaxis to be Tesla's next big thing

Tesla's leader, Elon Musk, has been teasing a robotaxi business for years. The pitch is simple: Any Tesla owner can essentially rent out their vehicles at any time, earning profits while they otherwise wouldn't be using the vehicle. This would make buying and owning a Tesla significantly more attractive. Businesses could be formed to buy hundreds or even thousands of Teslas for the purpose of renting them out. Tesla has also signaled plans to produce vehicles specifically for this purpose.

Autonomous driving is what will unlock this new business at scale. That way, Tesla owners can put their vehicles up for rent when they're not in use via their smartphone. Then, someone looking for a ride can request a pickup, and the nearest available Tesla will automatically drive itself to the user, pick them up, drop them at the requested destination, and return itself to the original parking spot before the owner even realizes that it's gone.

While details aren't available in full yet, the idea is that the vehicle owner and Tesla would split the rideshare earnings. Investor Cathie Wood sees this spawning a gigantic global robotaxi industry, potentially adding 1,000% in potential upside to Tesla's share price. ""We think $8 trillion to $10 trillion for the entire autonomous taxi opportunity throughout the world, from almost nothing,"" Wood said at an investor conference in March.

Some analysts are skeptical, given Tesla's previous promises of an imminent self-driving revolution. Consider one of Musk's previous declarations. ""Our goal is, and I feel pretty good about this goal, that we'll be able to do a demonstration drive of full autonomy all the way from LA to New York, from home in LA to let's say dropping you off in Times Square in New York, and then having the car go park itself, by the end of next year. Without the need for a single touch, including the charger."" He said this way back in 2016 -- nearly a decade ago. Rapid advances in artificial intelligence make today's possibilities much more realistic, however, and Tesla's robotaxi business could arrive much sooner than everyday investors realize.

When will Tesla start its robotaxi business?

Next week, Tesla is expected to begin a ""pilot"" robotaxi service in Austin, Texas. It will be a shell of itself, monitored and partially made possible by remote human operators. However, according to Musk, the vehicles will be using Tesla's first deployment of its fully unsupervised self-driving software. So, while humans will be in the mix, the vehicles will be attempting to operate fully autonomously.

While his previous predictions have typically proven overly optimistic, Musk believes this pilot project will scale to hundreds of thousands of the vehicles by late 2026. But even if it takes until the end of this decade to fully realize this vision, the consequences for Tesla and its stock price are clear. Right now, the traditional rideshare business in the U.S. is worth roughly $60 billion. But some market forecasts believe it could surpass a $300 billion valuation over the next five years, even with autonomous vehicles commanding just a small sliver of the market. If autonomous vehicles fully take off, this could be a trillion-dollar market by 2035 -- just as Cathie Wood predicts.

It's still early. Don't expect much from this business segment over the coming year or two apart from pilot test updates. But as analysts and large investors predict, Tesla's ridesharing business has the potential to revolutionize its revenue and profit streams over the next decade and beyond.",2025-06-21 08:05:00

Although some business owners become very successful, others end up shutting their doors after a few years. That's why Grant Cardone proposed another way to become rich.

""You gotta find somebody that is successful and still wants to be successful,"" he said.

Here's how you can use this advice to build long-term wealth.

You Don't Need 50 Investments

Cardone mentioned that you don't need 50 investments to become a billionaire. He said that Steve Jobs only had two investments. Pixar and NeXT were his two major investments before leaving Apple, and once he rejoined Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), that's where he got most of his wealth.

While diversifying your portfolio has benefits, there is the risk of over-diversification. Spreading your time and capital across too many investments can cause you to miss opportunities. Furthermore, you may spread your time too thin and end up with a bunch of slow-growing or declining income streams.

Picking a few good investments instead of having 50 investments can accelerate wealth building if you pick the right investments. It's not a strategy for everyone, but if you know the person behind the company and the growth opportunities, it may be worth considering.

Look At The Company's Leader

The leader plays a decisive role in the company's ability to tap into catalysts and provide long-term returns for patient investors.

If you want to see what type of an impact a leader can have on a corporation’s valuation, look no further than Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA). People have been saying that it's overvalued for years. If Elon Musk wasn't leading Tesla, the stock would probably be a lot cheaper. Recently, Tesla stock jumped higher the moment Musk said he would move away from the White House's Department of Government Efficiency to focus fully on Tesla. These trends demonstrate how much value Tesla investors put into Musk's involvement with the company.

Cardone suggested looking for leaders who still want to grow. He also recommended avoiding leaders who are complacent or are on the downswing of their careers.

Work With The Right Person

Cardone mentioned having a friend who would have made him billions if Cardone dropped everything to work with him at an early stage of his startup. You don't have to drop everything and put all of your hopes into a single startup, but it demonstrates how much you can grow if you work with the right person when they are getting started with a new venture.

Cardone then mentioned that Warren Buffett didn't start any businesses despite being worth billions. Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRK, NYSE:BRK) has relied on strategic acquisitions and investments to generate compounding returns for patient investors.

Buffett started one business – Buffett Partnership Ltd. – in 1956. However, he only put $100 of his money into it and received $105,000 from investors. Right from the beginning, Buffett used strategic leverage and acquisition to grow his empire. You don't always have to start a business and be the boss if you're surrounded by the right people and opportunities.

In that line of thought, here are 10 growth stock ideas for investors to consider. They range from a couple of high-profile household names, such as Tesla (TSLA -0.09%) and Delta Air Lines (DAL -0.76%), to companies like Navitas Semiconductor (NVTS 0.14%) and Synopsys (SNPS -0.71%), which are less well known.

You might want to consider buying and holding any (or all) of these equities long-term.

Tesla's robotaxis are a game-changer

The key to the investment case for Tesla lies in its promised robotaxis and unsupervised full self-driving (FSD) software, which is scheduled to launch on a limited basis beginning this week. Tesla is already a highly successful automaker and the dominant player in electric vehicles (EVs) in the U.S., and robotaxis offer the prospect of transforming it into a company able to generate high-margin and recurring revenue from owning its robotaxi fleet or revenue sharing from Tesla's transformed fleet using Full Self-Driving (FSD) software.

There's also the dedicated robotaxi, Cybercab, and the potential to sell FSD on a subscription basis. And all of it will be supported by Tesla's market-leading position in EVs and its ability to develop affordable EVs in the future.

Next-generation data centers

Nvidia partners Navitas Semiconductor and Vertiv (VRT -0.45%) and the next generation of data centers, namely 800-volt (V) high voltage direct current (HVDC), which I've discussed in more detail elsewhere, so investors with the time and inclination can peruse. Nvidia believes they will be more efficient, with lower maintenance costs and significantly lower costs of ownership.

The new data centers, scheduled for 2027, employ a different power conversion method, and Navitas is developing Gallium Nitride (GaN) and Silicon Carbide (SiC) power semiconductors to enable more efficient power conversion in 800V HVDC data centers.

Similarly, another Nvidia partner, and leading data center equipment provider, Vertiv, is developing critical power and cooling equipment and systems for the new data centers and expects to have them available in the second half of 2026, in time for the launch of the 800V HVDC data center in 2027.

What makes both companies particularly interesting is that, unlike their rivals, they are more like pure plays in their end markets. For example, Navitas specializes in GaN and SiC chips for power conversion (not silicon), and 80% of Vertiv's revenue comes from data centers.

Aehr Test Systems is opening up new end markets

Speaking of SiC and GaN chips, Aehr's (AEHR -3.13%) stock has soared recently on speculation that Navitas might be a customer for Aehr's testing and burn-in equipment. Aehr's equipment helps semiconductor manufacturers ensure quality and reliability throughout the manufacturing process.

Aehr has struggled recently as its revenue at SiC customers, including ON Semiconductor, has declined in light of pullbacks in EV investment. Still, Aehr is making good progress in opening up and winning customers in new markets, including GaN semiconductors and semiconductors for artificial intelligence (AI) processing.

Synopsys and the future of semiconductors

Synopsys is a leader in electronic design automation software (used to design and verify chips), and its intended acquisition of engineering simulation and analysis company Ansys is a key event. The aim is to create a company offering design software, as well as simulation and analysis software to test the fruits of the design. It will also open up Synopsys' solutions to Ansys' wider range of end-market customers, particularly as semiconductors and electronics are increasingly being embedded in a range of new industries.

Hexcel is the future of aerospace

The advanced materials company's lightweight composites are the future of the aerospace industry, as every new generation of airplane contains more composites. This means Hexcel (HXL 0.07%) can grow as airplane production increases (Airbus and Boeing have multiyear backlogs in place) and new, more composite-rich airplanes are developed.

Hexcel has faced headwinds in recent years as Airbus' and Boeing's delivery rates have fallen short of expectations, but it's only a matter of time before they improve.

Cognex's machine vision has long-term growth prospects

Cognex (CGNX -1.33%) is another company with excellent long-term secular growth prospects (the use of machine vision in automated processes) that has suffered near-term headwinds (weakness in key end markets like automotive and consumer electronics). Still, this is a temporary slowdown in a long-term growth story.

PTC, Trimble, and the growing interface between the digital and physical worlds

PTC (PTC 0.28%) provides computer-aided design (CAD), product lifecycle management (PLM), and other solutions essential to creating a so-called ""digital thread"" for a physical product as it moves from design through manufacturing, use, servicing, and ultimately disposal. As such, it's a leading player in the digitization of the industrial sector.

Trimble's (TRMB 0.18%) precise positioning hardware (its origins) and growing software/services also make it a leading play on digitization. In Trimble's case, it's about integrating physical positioning with the digital world, such as in construction and infrastructure work, transportation, and geospatial activities. Through the use of advanced analytics in the digital world, Trimble's solutions can be integrated into its customers' daily workflows.
