In a further sign that Apple s newest batch of iPhones are not selling as well as many had hoped  Broadcom s CEO Hock Tan said strong performance in the company s wireless divisions was driven by demand for older smartphones from a North American customer 
While Tan didn t mention Apple by name  the iPhone maker is Broadcom s largest North American partner  suggesting Apple has seen strong sales of older iPhone models  according to Bloomberg

"By    Apple  NASDAQ AAPL  allegedly moved nearly 9 billion Australian dollars   8 2 billion  in gross profits from its operations in Australia to Ireland in this decade  according to a report by the Australian Financial Review  or AFR  a local newspaper 
Following an investigation into the company s financial documents  AFR claimed that Apple paid only 0 7 percent of its turnover as tax in Australia where residents had bought  27 billion worth of products  The company  in a bid to save on taxes  reportedly moved about 8 9 billion Australian dollars   8 2 billion  to Ireland based Apple Sales International  which supplies and distributes Apple products  according to Agence France Presse 
 Apple worldwide in the past four years have avoided paying tax on  US44 billion  Apple s structure is perfectly legal under the current tax law  but they are very good at looking at loopholes and the current structure has  in a way  the blessing of the US government   Antony Ting  a senior lecturer of taxation law at Sydney University  told ABC News 
AFR also claimed that Apple had moved about 2 billion Australian dollars   1 8 billion  last year to Ireland  routing the money through Singapore  reporting pre tax earnings of just 88 5 million Australian dollars   79 7 million  in 2013 

The issue of global businesses moving money around to avoid paying local taxes was also raised at the G 20 meeting of finance ministers in Sydney in February  At the meeting  the ministers agreed to put in place an automatic exchange of information between members to reduce international tax evasion 
The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development will present a report on the subject at the September meeting of the G 20 in Cairns in northern Australia "
"Yesterday  Google s  GOOG  market cap reached  400 billion  which is a significant milestone for a number of reasons  At  400 billion GOOG has overtaken Exxon  XOM  as the second largest company in the US by market value 
Google and Exxon are obviously in much different industries  but it s worth noting that Exxon nearly generates as much in operating income as Google generates in revenue   Exxon s EBIT in 2013 was  57 7 B  while Google s revenue was  59 8 B   In fact  when you exclude the  4 4 B in revenue that came from Motorola  Exxon s operating income did exceed Google s revenue 
Google s market cap is obviously forecasting a lot of growth  but the company still really has only one source of revenue  and its market cap is starting to get pretty large even relative to that total opportunity   Total global advertising spend on digital advertisements was  118 B last year  and total ad spending overall was  517 B    Considering that Facebook  FB  also has a  170 B market cap  Google and Facebook combined now have market caps that exceed all advertising spend globally on all forms of media 
There have only been six other companies to ever hit the 400 level  and only one  Apple  currently maintains it   Apple s  AAPL  market cap is  485 B  so if Apple stays where it is  Google would become the largest company in the US if when its share price hits  1447

"Apple Inc  NASDAQ AAPL  has broken out of both a head and shoulders top  red neckline  and rising megaphone top  bright blue  and retested the breakouts on Friday 
What s especially juicy about the breakouts is that the blue rising megaphone is a topping pattern on a larger rising megaphone topping pattern  making for a potential set of nested head and shoulders patterns that could collapse like a house of cards 

Apple s  NASDAQ AAPL  Rising Megaphone Top  Blue  on a Larger Rising Megaphone Top  Pink  Makes for a Beautiful Set of Nested Head and Shoulders Tops
A head and shoulders pattern across the top of a rising megaphone top is classic  so the short set up is an exceptionally strong one  However  you always have to be a little careful about small breakouts that occur directly before and during opex week 
That means AAPL could still put in another right shoulder here  green scenario in top chart  
You could short on a breakout past the current breakout low  but play it a little slowly in case a triangle or megaphone right shoulder decides to form "
Amazon com  Inc    NASDAQ AMZN   has reportedly struck a deal with Salesforce com  Inc    NYSE CRM   per which Salesforce will build some parts of its Internet of Things  IoT  cloud software on Amazon Web Services  AWS  If the reports are true  Salesforce will be the latest to join the long list of AWS users that includes big names like Netflix  NASDAQ NFLX   Expedia  NASDAQ EXPE  and Adobe Systems  NASDAQ ADBE  Salesforce s IoT Cloud  introduced last fall  collects data from various connected devices such as smartphones  PCs  wearable devices and industrial sensors and recommends suitable actions to sales and customer service representatives  The service is still being tested and is expected to become commercially available later this year Microsoft Corporation   NASDAQ MSFT    General Electric Company   NYSE GE   and Amazon itself are some of Salesforce s peers in the IoT space With this move  it appears that Salesforce is planning a shift from data centers to cloud  at least partially  According to the executive vice president of Salesforce s IoT Cloud Adam Bosworth  AWS is a good choice when it comes to handling services that are expected to grow fast in the coming years  We had to have the safety valve of a public cloud or public clouds to do what we were doing   he added We note that enormous growth of Amazon s cloud business is bothering clients who prefer to keep options open to other cloud computing vendors as well  Earlier this year  Apple  NASDAQ AAPL  agreed to power part of its iCloud with Alphabet s cloud platform  in addition to AWS It s likely that Salesforce will also avoid being locked into AWS as signaled by Bosworth when he said   Salesforce has designed its IoT Cloud to run on any public cloud  as well as on servers within its own data centers    Where we go with this is probably a mix  because there are probably customers who want data to be controlled within our own data centers   he added At present  Amazon is a Zacks Rank  2  Buy  stock

"Investors are always looking for stocks that are poised to beat at earnings season and Lockheed Martin Corporation   NYSE LMT   may be one such company  The firm has earnings coming up pretty soon  and events are shaping up quite nicely for their report 
That is because Lockheed Martin is seeing favorable earnings estimate revision activity as of late  which is generally a precursor to an earnings beat  After all  analysts raising estimates right before earnings with the most up to date information possible is a pretty good indicator of some favorable trends underneath the surface for LMT in this report 
In fact  the Most Accurate Estimate for the current quarter is currently at  2 84 per share for LMT  compared to a broader Zacks Consensus Estimate of  2 76 per share  This suggests that analysts have very recently bumped up their estimates for LMT  giving the stock a Zacks Earnings ESP of 2 90  heading into earnings season 
Why Is This Important 
A positive reading for the Zacks Earnings ESP has proven to be very powerful in producing both positive surprises  and outperforming the market  Our recent 10 year backtest shows that stocks that have a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  or better show a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and have returned over 28  on average in annual returns  see more   
Given that LMT has a Zacks Rank  2  Buy  and an ESP in positive territory  investors might want to consider this stock ahead of earnings  You can see  
Clearly  recent earnings estimate revisions suggest that good things are ahead for Everest Re Group  and that a beat might be in the cards for the upcoming report

"SAN FRANCISCO  Reuters    Former Adobe Chief Marketing Officer Melissa Dyrdahl hopes to bring a spa like feel to the experience of breast cancer screenings 
Her start up  Ella Health  has opened seven mammogram centers across the United States  in places ranging from Toms River  New Jersey to San Francisco  Ella s pitch  to improve the often nerve wracking process so women will not skip their annual mammogram 
 We want women to feel like they re in a spa  not a cold and clinical hospital   Dyrdahl  who is chief executive of the company  said in an interview  For instance  Ella reminds its technicians to be  warm and caring  and gives patients a private dressing room and heated cloth robe 
In recent years  the company has secured capital to purchase 3D mammography units and offer a test that takes X rays at different angles of the breast  At some  450 000  the equipment is far more expensive than standard mammography units 
Dyrdahl  also a former marketing director at Apple Inc  O AAPL   said she joined the company after years of  terrible  mammogram experiences  Dyrdahl is herself a breast cancer survivor 
The American Cancer Society recommends that women over 40 get annual mammograms  but researchers have found that 50 percent of women with insurance opt out  even though most women in that age range are not responsible for additional out of pocket costs 
Ella Health is marketing its service to smaller  independent obstetricians and gynecologists  as well as directly to female patients 
It is branching out into other areas of women s health  It recently launched a physical therapy service linked to major life events  such as pregnancy and menopause  Dyrdahl said she is also exploring mental and sexual health 
Ella Health has raised funding from Polaris Venture Partners in Boston  CHL Medical Partners and private investors  The company is planning to raise additional funding in the coming year to fuel expansion across the United States

"The Apple  O AAPL  Trade Has Been Intriguing Recently 
There is a clear base that has formed over the past couple of weeks and if this stock manages to drop below  92    which not only represents the August lows that everyone thought was unreal and insane    but also represents the area that the stock bounced from in January and again this month  If that price level breaks  there will not only be major problems for the stock  but there will probably be a major correction to the market as well 
You also have a nice convergence of price with the 5   10  and 20 day moving averages right at or below the current price  When you look at overhead resistance if this stock manages to break decisively out of its base  you then have very little to get in the way of the breakout level and  107 on the chart  Granted  the market will have to engage in a massive rally in a process that takes price as high as 2040  or so  which isn t impossible  But it s too early to predict the possibility of such a price move taking place  Instead  I prefer to take this market just a day at a time and let current price action dictate what I will do on any given day 
It s also worth noting the declining trend line that still remains unbroken  Breaking the downtrend might be all that Apple needs to jump start the price action "

"Shares of Apple  NASDAQ AAPL  experienced their second biggest one day rally on Wednesday after the company announced its quarterly results  Most people looking at the stock s soaring price believe everything here is awesome 
However  what I see is blatant manipulation by Apple s management and market insiders 
Most people who casually follow the market don t understand the games played by companies and market insiders 
You see  even though Apple stock closed up 6 5  yesterday  the only thing that really matters for the company is in steep decline 
The thing I pay most attention to when I buy a stock is the company s sales  The firm s revenue is the foundation of any operating company  If you have no sales  you can t have profits  If you have no sales  you can t have cash flow  And if you have no sales  you have no customers 
When determining whether to buy a company s stock  the first thing I m looking at is sales 
From my experience  I can tell you that most company management teams hesitate to manipulate sales  It s a bit harder to do  and bean counters can tell pretty quickly if a company is misstating its sales 
However  it s incredibly easy to manipulate profits or earnings  Many companies invent their own ways to state their profits  It s what I call  everything but the bad stuff  accounting 
Apple Earnings Smoke and Mirrors
With Wall Street s preference for accounting shenanigans and sleight of hand in mind  let s look at Apple 
Overall  Apple reported that sales were down 15   The company s main source of sales   iPhones   was down 23   What s more  sales in China   which used to be Apple s fastest growing market   were down 29   And sales in the Americas   Apple s largest geographic market   were down 6  
The only sales number where Apple is seeing growth is in services  which was up 19   It s no wonder then that CEO Tim Cook used the word  services  eight times in his opening remarks 
However  services represent just  6 billion  or 14  of total Apple sales of  42 3 billion  Truth is  Apple s services division will never be big enough to offset the massive decline in growth in iPhones 
In my experience  the combination of Apple s massive sales decline and the fact that Apple CEO Cook is highlighting  services  is the kind of manipulation that tells me a stock is going to fall 
Don t Get Suckered by Wall Street
We have a company that is facing declining sales growth across the board  and yet the shares spiked sharply higher in trading  How could that happen 
It s an instance of Wall Street crooks trying to get you to buy stock that they are trying to dump 
You see  they know that most people won t read Apple s financial statements to find out that its business is in decline  However  they know that everyone will read in the news today and tomorrow that Apple s stock is up 
And these Wall Street crooks know that they ll get most people to hold on to their stock instead of selling it  The sharp rebound will also interest others in buying shares 
Once they get these suckers in  Apple s stock will resume the downtrend it started in April 2015 when it peaked at  131 
If you re shocked  you shouldn t be  Wall Street and company management teams play games like this all the time 
If you re looking to take advantage of the growth happening within the tech sector  there are better stocks out there than Apple  and I ll be keeping you locked in to those opportunities "

Microsoft Corporation  MSFT  is finally doing something that I have been calling for over the past several years  With CEO Steve Ballmer set to leave the company  the former Wall Street favorite is making plans to aggressively expand its presence in the growing mobility market  How  Through its proposed acquisition of the cell phone business Nokia Corporation  NOK   a deal valued at up to  7 2 billion  in an effort to expand in a sector dominated by Apple Inc   AAPL  and Samsung Electronics Co  Ltd The deal that sees Microsoft buying the mobile unit  including the  Lumia  line running on a  Windows  platform  makes perfect sense for a company that is falling behind in the mobile race  For Nokia  the deal also makes sense  as the company probably realized it was going to be a tough upward battle against Apple  Samsung  and a host of other Chinese smartphone makers  Essentially  Nokia made a conscious decision to exit before it was lights out  As far as Microsoft  the purchase of Nokia s mobile business also makes a lot of sense  as Microsoft struggles to advance its presence in the mobile space while facing declining demand for its Windows platform on personal computers  PCs  and laptops There was really no other choice for Microsoft  and given the company has  76 0 billion in cash  the price  or gamble  is worth it  But again  there s absolutely no guarantee the strategy will pan out The Lumia smartphones had good reviews  but failed to crack the lock on the smartphone market placed by Apple in the United States and Samsung worldwide  Just look at BlackBerry Limited  BBRY  and its recent decision to put out the  For Sale  sign Microsoft  unlike Nokia  has the financial clout to drive the Lumia Windows phone  but whether it can fare better is still debatable  The reality is that unless Microsoft comes out with a better smartphone than its rivals  it will likely be more of the same as it tries to expand its current three percent market share My opinion is that while it will be very difficult for Microsoft to break into this market  it s well worth the gamble  as the mobility sector is the place where the growth will continue to be on the horizon Disclaimer  There is no magic formula to getting rich  Success in investment vehicles with the best prospects for price appreciation can only be achieved through proper and rigorous research and analysis  The opinions in this e newsletter are just that  opinions of the authors  Information contained herein  while believed to be correct  is not guaranteed as accurate  Warning  Investing often involves high risks and you can lose a lot of money  Please do not invest with money you cannot afford to lose

"For most of my career  I ve been a tireless advocate of a single investing principle  that stock prices ultimately follow earnings 
I mean that if a company continues to increase its earnings quarter after quarter  its stock price is bound to trade higher  too  And vice versa 
My faith  mind you  is well founded  Ironclad studies demonstrate that the price performance of the S P 500 index does indeed track profit growth 
As a result  I consider earnings growth a reliable leading indicator when evaluating stocks  But more and more  I m becoming convinced that an even better leading indicator may exist   patent filings 
The IP Factor
Before a company can book a single penny in profit  it needs a product to sell  Yet in today s fiercely competitive global economy  before a company can produce something to sell  it needs to patent the idea 
Otherwise  it s too easy for competitors to knock off the product and steal market share 
In other words  being first to market is no longer enough of a competitive advantage 
Companies need to be first to market and have patents protecting their products to ensure sales and profit longevity 
Groupon  NASDAQ GRPN  and Apple  NASDAQ AAPL  serve as good examples of this new paradigm 
As you re well aware  Groupon invented the daily deals market in 2008  All it took was a novel idea to connect consumers and businesses in a new way   via coupons over email 
But guess what 
Groupon didn t have even one patent protecting its novel business model  And within four years  over 300 competitors emerged  Now Groupon doesn t stand a chance to keep booking higher profits  let alone surviving 
Contrast Groupon s experience with the details behind the meteoric rise of Apple and you ll definitely get the connection between patent filings and stock price performance 
We can all agree that Apple took the world by storm with its iPhone launch in June 2007  Before it sold a single one  though  it secured as many patents as possible  And it continued to do the same thing on every next generation device 
So what happens if we chart Apple s patent filing activity against its stock price performance 
Well  a clear connection emerges 

As you can see  the number of patent filings increased significantly before Apple s stock price increased significantly 
Coincidence  Hardly 
The uptick in patent filings signaled an uptick in innovation at Apple  And the patent filings proved to be a reliable indication of new  potentially game changing products in development 
Once the products hit the market  their market potential was realized  which showed up in increased sales and profits 
Bottom line  While earnings growth remains a reliable indicator  we d be well served to add patent filings to our repertoire  too  It s an even earlier indicator of stock price performance "
"Currencies
EUR USD   trades near the lowest level since December 2002 and we can say a 14 year low  When news about the attack in Berlin broke we saw the EUR weaken further  The stronger data out of Germany was not really able to lift the EUR as the USD also strengthened over the course of the day  in part also due to some positive comments from FED Chair Yellen mainly concerning the US job market 
USD JPY   initially strengthened due to insecurity and safe haven buying when back to back news about the assassination of the Russian ambassador in Turkey and a few hours later the terror attack in Berlin  However  it has already pared all of yesterday s losses after the BOJ kept both the interest rate as well as monetary policy unchanged as was expected  It did upgrade its outlook for the Japanese economy  in part helped due to the weaker JPY which should spur exports  
GBP USD    dropped to the lowest level in a month as renewed concerns over the repercussion of the Brexit vote are in focus again  Scotland plans to hold a new referendum on separating from the UK if it is unable to remain part of the EU single market due to the Brexit 
AUD USD   the RBA keeps the possibility open for further monetary easing as it kept the interest rate unchanged at the last meeting  
USD TRY    when news broke that the Russian ambassador in Turkey was shot in Ankara  immediate weakness in the TRY could be witnessed 
Indices
DAX 30   saw some downside when reports on the terror attack in Berlin filtered through  However  it is moving up again this morning and is trading near the highest level since August 2015 
S P 500   even though it twice dropped due to geopolitical events  the assassination of the Russian ambassador in Turkey and the terror attack in Berlin  it managed to recover quite quickly and managed to close the day higher and is continuing this trend today 

Commodities
Gold   we would expect to see gold move higher  which is did but only marginally  even though there were enough reasons for gold to move higher due to the events of yesterday  However  USD strength filtered through and hampered gold from taking full advantage 
Oil   is looking for a direction as it swings back and forth a little bit  We will be waiting to see what will happen with the inventories and production in the US and obviously we can always expect comments on the commitment of OPEC members to really follow through on cutting production 
Stocks
Apple  NASDAQ AAPL    as was widely expected  Apple filed an appeal to the EU Commission decision from august that the company received tax breaks amounting to up to  13 billion 
Boeing  NYSE BA    announced that it will be cutting more jobs than previously thought as it sees demand for aircraft slow down  On the other hand  Airbus suffered a blow as well as Iran decided not to purchase any Airbus A380 s and reduced the order to  only  100 aircraft of different types  Perhaps Boeing could benefit from this "
The news broke out right after I wrote the first draft of this commentary on BlackBerry Limited  NASDAQ BBRY   a surprise takeover bid emerged from Fairfax Financial Holdings Ltd   FFH  offering  9 00 per share  or  4 7 billion  for the struggling smartphone maker  It appears to be the correct timing for BlackBerry  And for BlackBerry CEO Thorsten Gerhard Heins  he could get a  20 0 million send off for selling the company  This was the situation prior to the takeover announcement to take BlackBerry private  BlackBerry reported a massive fiscal second quarter loss of  1 0 billion  highlighted by the write off of about  930  960 million of its inventory  The company also announced plans to axe 4 500 jobs  or 40  of its workforce  as my stock analysis indicates  The inventory adjustment is frightening  based on my stock analysis  It implies the company cannot sell its  Z10  and  Q5 Q10  devices  Again  this isn t a surprise  as my stock analysis notes that BlackBerry has consistently screwed up in its execution over the past few years to the point that it allowed rivals  such as Apple Inc   AAPL  and Samsung Electronics Co  Ltd   to bulldoze over BlackBerry  leaving just a pile of scraps BlackBerry said it sold about 3 7 million smartphones in the quarter  Honestly  that number really stinks  based on my stock analysis  especially considering Apple announced it had sold nine million units of its new  iPhone 5  in the first weekend The numbers are telling  but this has been the issue for BlackBerry for years  according to my stock analysis  In a never ending battle to regain its lost luster  my stock analysis suggests that BlackBerry has continued to fight a losing battle  struggling to keep up with a market that already passed it by long ago Well  now there s a  Plan C  for BlackBerry that may be kept  despite the proposed sale  and the irony is that it may work  according to my stock analysis What s the plan  BlackBerry will focus on its corporate base and likely exit the consumer market  While store shelves may still be filled with BlackBerry s newest product gathering dust  the company still has a decent client base to which it can market its corporate services The company also plans to market its fairly popular proprietary messaging system  BlackBerry Messenger   or  BBM   for free to iPhone and  Android  users  The hope is that the BBM service will expand to tens of millions of its rival devices and become as popular as Twitter The positive about the sale and privatization of BlackBerry is that the company will have time to try to execute its strategy instead of trying to satisfy Wall Street and investors  according to my stock analysis  If Fairfax can turn BlackBerry around  we could see the company listed again in the future Disclaimer  There is no magic formula to getting rich  Success in investment vehicles with the best prospects for price appreciation can only be achieved through proper and rigorous research and analysis  The opinions in this e newsletter are just that  opinions of the authors  Information contained herein  while believed to be correct  is not guaranteed as accurate  Warning  Investing often involves high risks and you can lose a lot of money  Please do not invest with money you cannot afford to lose

"Goldman Sachs  NYSE GS  is back on their Brexit  hiring fewer investment bankers   and recruiting more programmers as it continues its fight to become a digital consumer bank  on top of everything else it s doing on Wall Street 




Pretty much all Wall Street is back on their Brexit   but Goldman s reductions in job postings from their 2018 peak  457  to near current day  163  is staggering  Thinknum Alternative Data can be used to track companies  job postings in any nation  and the only other substantial Goldman hub that trimmed job postings in 2019 is Hong Kong  And there s nothing going on in Hong Kong right now  right 




It shouldn t be a shock to many that investment banking job postings are declining  The turbulent markets in 2019  combined with the fact they have to follow a 2018 that generated record M A announcments  have put a damper on deals  That goes to directly banks  revenue   but Goldman is Wall Street s perennial M A powerhouse 




Accordingly  job postings are down 51   according to data   Wells Fargo   NYSE WFC  analysts wrote  in a Sept  30 research note  that  lower 3Q19 estimates for  Goldman Sachs  reflect a reduction in revenue projections for investment banking  9  lower than prior estimate    and most banks dependent on dealmakers had better hope their FICC teams showed up in Q3  instead  
Finally  nevermind what the Wall Street Journal said  for the record   Marcus has lost  1 3 billion since launching in 2016    Goldman doesn t look to be giving up on consumer banking anytime soon  Between its partnership with Apple  NASDAQ AAPL  earlier this year  and its United Capital deal  the bank looks increasingly committed to picking up more clients that would be with other bulge bracket banks and advisors  And if  Citigroup   NYSE C  can court consumers via app  Goldman isn t just going to let it have the market all to itself  
Accordingly  perhaps  Goldman Sachs  NYSE GS  job postings have risen more than 70  since Q3 kicked off   
The bank is expected to report EPS of  5 15 by analysts tracked by Zacks Investment Research  when Goldman announces earnings October 15  
About the Data  
Thinknum tracks companies using information they post online   jobs  social and web traffic  product sales and app ratings   and creates data sets that measure factors like hiring  revenue and foot traffic  Data sets may not be fully comprehensive  they only account for what is available on the web   but they can be used to gauge performance factors like staffing and sales "
"Apple shares  NASDAQ AAPL  recorded a new intraday high on Monday following reports that revealed a strong and rising demand for their premium iPhone X unit 
The company unveiled three new iPhone devices this September at their annual Apple event  During the event  Apple unveiled the iPhone 8 and 8 Plus  as well as the iPhone X which is released in celebration of the tenth anniversary of the device  Although the iPhone 8 and 8 Plus was released two weeks after the event  investors and analysts were dismayed to hear that the premium iPhone X will be released two months later in November 
This led to lesser than expected demand and sales reports for the iPhone 8 and 8 Plus  Although most investors expected slightly smaller order numbers for the iPhone 8 and 8 Plus  estimated numbers and reports have previously revealed during the past month that the company has been receiving far less pre order numbers for the said unit as the markets awaited the release of the iPhone X 
Although Apple shares suffered in the past couple of months due to weak sales outlook as well as mixed reviews on its Apple Watch Series 3 which was released alongside the latest iPhone line  Apple s stock traded to a new all time high on Monday to  168 07 per share following reports of surge in the demand and pre orders for the special tenth anniversary edition of the iPhone 
The pre orders for the premium iPhone which began last week also happens to be the company s most expensive iPhone which will be sold starting at a selling price of  1 000  The device is known to have features such as facial expression unlocking and wireless charging capabilities 
Various reports have recently surfaced stating that the demand for the iPhone X has been growing with speculations for the iPhone X supply to come at around two to three million devices following its availability which will be sold in stores starting this week 
Although Apple has not officially revealed numbers in the past  analysts have noted that the current supply will be lower than to that of the iPhone 6 release which was estimated to have come at around six to ten million during its official release  During the past couple of months  various sources have stated that Apple might have faced issues in the production of the latest iPhone units due to its brand new design 
Due to the initial pre order reports for the iPhone X  Apple shares have recorded a new intraday high and is expected to surge further in the coming days as the company releases its quarterly earnings report and kicks off the official selling of its iPhone X in its retail stores "
"By Christian Shepherd and Yawen Chen BEIJING  Reuters    China and the United States can resolve any trade disputes through talks  the government said on Thursday  as a Chinese newspaper warned U S  business could be targets for retaliation in any trade war ushered in by President elect Donald Trump  Trump  who is sworn into office on Friday  has criticised China s trade practices and threatened to impose punitive tariffs on Chinese imports  Billionaire investor Wilbur Ross  Trump s choice for commerce secretary  voiced sharp criticism of China s trade practices on Wednesday  telling senators he would seek new ways of combating them  Chinese Commerce Ministry spokesman Sun Jiwen said the government was willing to work with the new U S  administration to promote the healthy development of commercial ties   I believe China and the United States can resolve any disputes through dialogue and negotiation and that the China U S  commercial relationship will not significantly stray from the path of mutual benefit   Sun told reporters    Both sides benefit with cooperation  and both are hurt with conflict   he added  Chinese Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying said any disputes should be resolved via constructive talks  to avoid any miscalculations   We look forward to working hard with the new U S  government  adhering to no clashes and no confrontation   she told a separate briefing  But a high powered economist and a widely read state run newspaper took a harsher line  Chen Wenling  chief economist at the China Centre for International Economic Exchanges  an influential think tank with close government ties  said China does not desire a trade war but it is certainly not afraid of one   If you want a fight  then we will fight and we will fight to the end   Chen said    But the U S  will be the first to be injured and their injuries will be more severe   she said  adding that China could  definitely defeat the U S    In an editorial  the Global Times said that as the United States has the stronger economy  China may suffer more once a trade war starts  but China  will take the U S  on to the end     There are few cases in modern history where only one party surrendered in a trade war  rather  the two parties ended up compromising with each other  How could Trump s team believe China would surrender without any countermeasures   it said   The arrogant Trump team has underestimated China s ability to retaliate  China is a major buyer of American cotton  wheat  beans and Boeing  NYSE BA  aircraft   the paper added in the editorial carried in its Chinese and English language editions  without elaborating  Boeing Co s China office declined to comment  Boeing anticipates China will need 6 800 new jetliners worth  1 trillion over the next 20 years  In October  Boeing and Chinese planemaker Commercial Aircraft Corp of China Ltd  COMA   CMAFC UL  signed an agreement to open a Boeing 737 completion facility in the Chinese coastal city of Zhou  The Global Times  run by the ruling Communist Party s official People s Daily  is known for its stridently nationalist tone  but its editorials cannot be viewed as representing government policies or official statements  In recent weeks  the Global Times and other state run Chinese news outlets have issued several warnings of possible retaliation if the Trump administration carries out threats of tariffs or undermines Beijing s claims on self ruled Taiwan  In November  the Global Times warned that China could switch large orders from Boeing to Europe  Apple  NASDAQ AAPL  phones would  essentially be crowded out  and U S  soybeans and corn banished from China if Trump creates problems for China on trade  
China is the world s top producer and consumer of cotton and top buyer of grains such as soybeans to feed its vast livestock industry "
"After a bloody start to the week on full blown trade tensions  markets bounced back on Wednesday  A trade war is now real as China has decided to hit back at the tariff hike by the United States on  200 billion worth of Chinese goods starting May 10  The increased Chinese tariff on  60 billion worth of U S  imports will be put into effect on Jun 1  Not only this  Trump will impose 25  tax on an extra  325 billion of Chinese goods  shortly  
While markets reacted negatively to the news at the start of May  efforts for bottom fishing probably have boosted sentiments   is now in correction  Big names of the Dow Jones Industrial Average with solid exposure to global trade   Intel  NASDAQ INTC    Boeing  NYSE BA    Caterpillar  NYSE CAT    3M  NYSE MMM   and Apple  NASDAQ AAPL     are all down 20  or more from their 52 week highs  Meanwhile  Trump also indicated that trade talks are not dead yet 
Why the Rebound 
With the U S  economy still in fine fettle  some investors probably want to dig into the undervalued status of the stock market  The Dow Jones rose about 207 points on May 14   in a month  Tech heavy Invesco QQQ Trust  added about 1 1  on May 14  read    
In a note to clients on Monday  Citi said its China economists are  cautiously optimistic that a trade deal can eventually be signed   But it added that the  window to avoid further escalations in US China tensions is closing fast   per an article posted on CNBC 
Overall  all those sectors and ETFs that are highly linked to trade tensions and lost heavily early in the week  tried to regain ground and posted the maximum gains  These ETFs include S P Oil   Gas Eqpt   Services SPDR   Up 3 4    Oil Services Vaneck ETF   CA OIH    Up 3 4    Ipatha B Grains Subindex TR ETN   Up 3 2    Teucrium Soybean   Up 3 1    DWA Technology Momentum Invesco ETF   V PTF    Up 2 8    Alps Medical Breakthroughs ETF   SI SBIO    Up 2 6   and Semiconductor Vaneck ETF   Up 2 6   
China centric ETFs like Xtrackers MSCI China A Inclusion Equity ETF   up 3 4    Reality Shares Nasdaq Nexgen Economy China ETF   Up 3 1   and VanEck Vectors ChinaAMC CSI 300 ETF   AX PEK    up 2 8   have also posted material gains on May 14

But Will the Rally Last  
A full scale trade war means lower global growth and corporate profits  which will eventually drag stocks down  The New York Fed s gauge of recession probability over the coming one year   the highest since the financial crisis 
Inflation outlook is darkening as well  with the spread between the 5 year Treasury note and the 5 year Inflation Protected Treasury Security is at  level  pointing to 1 75  inflation  below the Fed s desired 2  level  per CNBC 
Coming to Fed s action  forget about rate hikes  there is nearly a  of a 25 bp rate cut in September  according to the CME  The chance of a rate cut in June meeting is 13 3  
Is It Time to Flock to Safer Bet  
Against this backdrop  investors can bet on safer ETFs like SPDR Gold Shares  NYSE GLD    V GLD    InfraCap REIT Preferred ETF   which yields about 4 39    Invesco S P 500 Low Volatility ETF   Invesco Taxable Municipal Bond ETF   LON BAB    yields 4 09  annually  and Global X SuperDividend U S  ETF   TO DIV    yields 7 25  annually   read

"In a world where Amazon  NASDAQ AMZN  is killing its competitors  it s tough to find another consumer company which has so consistently exceeded expectations  The sportswear giant   Nike   NYSE NKE  is certainly one of them 
The company said on Tuesday it earned  0 86 a share in its fiscal first quarter that ended last month  crushing analysts  estimates  These quarterly earnings per share topped even the most bullish Wall Street estimate by  0 13 cents  Sales rose 7  from a year earlier and expanded 10  after adjusting for currency swings 
Nike  has topped quarterly earnings estimates more than 90  of the time over the past 11 years during a period when online disruptors  such as Amazon  gained a major share of consumer spending 
At the forefront of this great upside is the company s  Triple Double Strategy   which means doubling its resources on its digital properties  accelerating innovation and product creation  and deepening one to one connections 
Many executives use similar language when they communicate with shareholders  but when it comes to Nike  there is visible solid progress on the ground to back it up  The Nike brand has become a powerful  statement name  whose sports shoes and clothing ranges are now worn everywhere  and not just in the gym  or on the soccer field 
Nike Is Winning Everywhere
The result of these efforts is that Nike is grabbing a greater market share from its main European rival  Adidas AG  DE ADSGN   even in its home market  while outperforming in the major growth markets of Asia 
In the latest report  Nike s sales in China  for example  surged 27   excluding currency effects  despite the escalating trade war that  technically  should hit American brands in the communist nation hard 
One major area where Nike has excelled is in its online strategy  which is helping to cut costs  boost sales and expand its margins  Nike s digital sales rose 42  from a year earlier in its first quarter  after they rose 35  growth in the last fiscal year  In Q1  they expanded across all regions with North America posting a 30  gain  Europe  the Middle East and Africa a double digit increase  Asia Pacific and Latin America rising 50  and China jumping over 70  
Nike maintained its year revenue growth target of high single digits  but boosted its gross margin expansion forecast to 50 75 basis points  It had been projecting a 50 basis point increase 





Such a strong report was enough to send Nike shares soaring  Its stock rose 4 16  yesterday to close at  90 81  having touched a new record of  92 79 during the day  After yesterday s gains  the shares are up about 24  this year  continuing the spectacular ascent that has doubled their value during the past five years 
Following this powerful rally  Nike valuations look quite rich with its stock trading at a price to earnings multiple of about 35  That means a company which makes shoes and t shirts will have to grow faster than Facebook  NASDAQ FB   or Apple  NASDAQ AAPL  to justify these valuations  The majority of analysts  however  don t believe it will be a problem for Nike to pull that off  Susquehanna analyst  Sam Poser  said 
 Compelling initiatives and strategic investments  particularly in digital  reinforce Nike s evolution and should lead to sustainable high single digit FX neutral growth and margin expansion   
Bottom Line
Nike is a solid dividend paying stock  offering a quarterly payout of  0 22 and a yield of 1 01   that could be stashed in any long term portfolio in order to benefit from the company s strong growth momentum and expanding income stream  The strength in the company s gross margin is especially encouraging  It shows the underlying soundness of Nike s strategic initiatives which are transforming the sportswear giant into a high margin business "

"By Hyunjoo Jin and Joyce Lee SEOUL  Reuters    Samsung Electronics  KS 005930  Co Ltd on Friday said it expected to take a hit to its operating profit of about  3 billion over the next two quarters due to the discontinuation of its fire prone Galaxy Note 7 smartphone  The outlook brings to about  5 3 billion the total losses the global smartphone leader has forecast as a result of the overheating issues  after it said on Wednesday it would suffer a  2 3 billion hit to third quarter profit   The premium device that was meant to compete with Apple  NASDAQ AAPL  Inc s latest iPhones at the top end of the smartphone market had to be scrapped earlier this week  less than two months after its launch  due to safety fears  The South Korean tech giant said in a statement on Friday it expected the blow to profit to be in the mid 3 trillion won over the next two quarters   in the mid 2 trillion won range in the October December period and about 1 trillion won   900 million  for the first quarter of 2017   Samsung shares  which have fallen about 8 percent this week  edged up 0 6 percent as of 0228 GMT on Friday  versus a 0 5 percent gain on the broader market  To make up for the lost revenue  Samsung said it would expand sales of gadgets like the Galaxy S7 and S7 edge phones  and make  significant changes  in its quality assurance processes to improve product safety  Investors and analysts said that while the company had to move quickly to reassure the market about the potential financial costs  deeper losses from one of the tech industry s most spectacular product failures could not be ruled out  Reputational damage remained the great unknown and potentially more harmful than recall costs  with rivals in the cut throat industry eager to pounce on any sign of weakness in the market leader s standing among consumers   The sales impact on other models remains unclear   said Kim Sung soo  a fund manager at LS Asset Management  which owns Samsung Electronics shares   The end of the premium model will damage Samsung s brand  and hurt demand for its other models  It is difficult to measure such impact    Samsung posted earnings of  7 2 billion in the second quarter  with mobile profits   its biggest earner   soaring 57 percent  REBUILDING TRUST The Note 7 debacle has come at an awkward time for South Korea s biggest family run conglomerate  which is in the middle of a leadership succession and is facing calls for a major restructuring from U S  hedge fund Elliott Management  Park Jung hoon  a fund manager at HDC Asset Management which owns shares in Samsung affiliates  said that although future losses would not be as bad as the third quarter the company had to work hard to rebuild confidence   What s important is whether the flagship S7 can fill the gap left by the Note 7  and how much trust Samsung can regain from consumers by the time the S8 comes out   he said  Analysts expect the S8 to be released in the first quarter  Key to brand recovery would be rapidly finding out and communicating what went wrong with the Note 7  which was recalled when some devices were found to be combustible and finally discontinued when customers reported similar faults in their replacements  The company blamed faulty batteries for the original problem but it has given no inkling about the cause of overheating in the replacements    Samsung must announce clearly what the reason was and dispel uncertainty   Park said  Investors were also expecting the company to show its  commitment to shareholders  by announcing share buybacks or higher dividends  he said  
Samsung has announced financial incentives for U S  and South Korea customers who exchange Note 7s for other Samsung products  as part of efforts to stem customer defections "
"On Monday  the Spanish data protection authority  AEPD  said that social media giant Facebook Inc    NASDAQ FB   has been violating privacy rules regarding the way it uses people s personal data for advertising purposes 
Because of this  the AEPD has fined Facebook  1 2 Million  or about  1 44 million  This marks yet another fine against Facebook for privacy violations in Europe 
In particular  Spain s AEPD is investigating how Facebook collected data on ideology  sex  religious beliefs  personal tastes  and navigation  and believes the company is doing so without obtaining adequate user consent  Total sanctions could amount to  300 000 for each of the first breaches and  600 000 for the second 
Not having proper consent to users  personal data is  classified as a very serious offense under local DP law    
The company s use of web browsing cookies  which is a tool that helps websites keep track of a user s visits and activity  has come under fire as well  The AEPD said users are not made aware of when their personal data is being processed through cookies when browsing non Facebook pages that contain one of Facebook s social  Like  buttons 
Spain s data regulator also claims that Facebook does not delete harvested data once the tech company is done using it  and believes Facebook doesn t delete data from web browsing habits  but  retains and reuses it later associated with the same user  
Facebook has been fined for similar violations in the past by Belgium  which it successfully overturned the ruling  as well as France  the Netherlands  and Germany 
Read Facebook s full statement below 
 We take note of the DPA s decision with which we respectfully disagree  Whilst we value the opportunities we ve had to engage with the DPA to reinforce how seriously we take the privacy of people who use Facebook  we intend to appeal this decision 
 As we made clear to the DPA  users choose which information they want to add to their profile and share with others  such as their religion  However  we do not use this information to target adverts to people  
 Facebook has long complied with EU data protection law through our establishment in Ireland  We remain open to continuing to discuss these issues with the DPA  whilst we work with our lead regulator the Irish Data Protection Commissioner as we prepare for the EU s new data protection regulation in 2018  
Shares of Facebook are currently up about 1 2  in late morning trading  while the stock is a  3  Hold  on the Zacks Rank

FTSE to buck trend with weak open
Stocks in Europe look set for a positive open on Wednesday  extending a run of good form at the beginning of the fourth quarter  Stocks in the UK are bucking the trend with the FTSE 100 expected to open lower  It s a natural pullback for the FTSE from the 7 week highs reached yesterday  The recent slide in oil prices is hurting the performance of the heavy concentration of energy and resource sectors in UK markets  Asian investors have taken a downgrade to 2018 growth forecasts from the World Bank in their stride  A cut in China s reserve requirements this week underscores why investors might not be so worried  Any growth slowdown is expected to be shield by the Chinese government 
Wall Street powers on
Futures point to a higher open on Wall Street despite problems at two of America s tech giants  Amazon  NASDAQ AMZN  and Yahoo  NASDAQ AABA   now owned by Verizon   It has been reported the European Commission will require Luxemburg to collect back taxes from Amazon  Yahoo has announced all 3bn of its accounts were affected by the 2013 data breach  Right on the heels of the problems at Equifax  NYSE EFX   Yahoo s admission is another blow to consumer confidence in the security of their data held at big tech companies 
EU fight with Luxemburg damaging to Amazon
It s very reminiscent of the situation with Apple  NASDAQ AAPL  and Ireland  It will probably pan out the same way with denials and years of litigation  Ultimately there will probably not be any admission to illegal state support or tax evasion  but there will be consequences  Once the dust has settled  multinational companies will just choose to avoid the bad PR and legal tussles by paying a fairer rate of tax on European profits  The days of sweetheart tax deals inside Europe like Amazon s James Bond esque  Goldcrest project  with Luxemburg will soon be over 
The ruling could be much more damaging for Amazon than it was Apple  The amounts involved are lot less than with Apple  but as a proportion of earnings  what the EU is asking of Amazon is much higher  Figures from the FT indicate  4bn in profit was funnelled into a non taxable entity in Luxemburg   1bn of which was sent to the US and taxed  If the remaining  3bn was taxed by Luxemburg at 30   that would be around half of Amazon s 2016 full year earnings  Amazon has a near  500bn market cap because investors tolerate its low profits in exchange for revenue growth and market domination  It s less certain how long investors would tolerate no profits or losses  which might be the result if Amazon were paying higher taxes in Europe  Should Amazon s tax burden rise  either its profits will be lower or it will be forced to reduce its heavy investment spending  capping its future growth potential "

The markets were suspiciously subdued Sunday night   developing thrust  perhaps  for the next maniacal surge  In retrospect  it seems remarkable that the broad averages were able to sustain an upward trajectory in recent weeks even as the most valuable stock in the world  Apple  AAPL   was getting savaged   Breaking news  Apple has fallen to second place  its cap value now exceeded by that of Exxon Mobil  XOM   The stock has plummeted 37  since September  from an all time high of  705 to Friday s shell shocked low of  435  It must be conceded that even at  705  AAPL was not egregiously overpriced relative to earnings  Presumably  Wall Street s renowned shakedown artists have been intent on driving AAPL down to bargain basement prices because they re so confident they ll be able to goose the stock back into the ionosphere before their 2013 bonuses are calculated  Well  it s optimists that make the world go  round  so perhaps we shouldn t be so churlish as to deny them the spoils of such deftly executed opportunism  For our part  we ve hated the stock market each and every step of the way up since  oh  2009  But it s not as though we re sore losers  In fact  much of the time  we not only had the rallies nailed  we were able to profit from them on the way up   and even to short them when they reached swing highs nicely foreseen by Hidden Pivot analysis  We recently attempted this gambit once again as the E Mini S Ps approached an important rally target at 1494 50  We came especially eagerly to this task  since we d just come off a bullish ride from  effectively  1433  But discretion prevailed over valor  and we backed away with the futures glowering menacingly near 1500 as last week ended  Unapologetic permabear that we are  a thrust above 1500 would only increase our determination to short the top of this nearly four year old bullish stampede  Be assured that this reflex is not be based on some vague hunch  or even on the suspicion that a rally launched from 1500 would be the perfect way for Mr  Market to set the Mother of All Bull Traps  No  we have a very specific target in mind  and it is based on a chart pattern that looks extremely likely to produce a short able top  if not necessarily The Top

"By Julia Love  Reuters    Theranos Chief Executive Elizabeth Holmes fought back on Wednesday against accusations that the technology at the heart of the blood testing startup has grave flaws   Holmes defended her company at a technology conference hosted in Laguna Beach by the Wall Street Journal  which last week published a pair of stories suggesting her startup was relying on tools from traditional labs as it struggled with its own technology  But Holmes said the company has moved away from one of its devices only briefly as it transitions to getting approval from the Food and Drug Administration for all of its tests  She cited her successful lobbying for an Arizona law allowing patients to get blood tests without a doctor s order   I personally in Arizona worked very hard to change the law   she said   I can t do that without knowing that the tests that are offered are of the highest quality   Theranos  which has a valuation of  9 billion  promised to shake up medical testing by conducting a wide range of tests with one drop of blood from a finger stick  rather than the large vial typically collected  But the Journal has reported that the company now uses the tiny vials  known as nanotainers  for just one of its tests  responding to concerns from regulators  The newspaper also reported that former employees doubt the reliability of Edison  the company s proprietary lab tool  While it is used for just a fraction of tests  it is key to Theranos s strategy  Holmes acknowledged that Theranos has used technology from other labs for tests from venous draws but stressed that the company relies on its own technology for finger stick tests  She noted that Theranos has received FDA approval for one test and expects to get clearance for others   We are the exact same company that we were   she said   We ve done 3 5 million tests  We have tens of thousands of people who have rated our service   Holmes  31  is a darling of Silicon Valley  drawing comparisons to the late Apple  O AAPL  founder Steve Jobs for her bold vision and penchant for wearing black turtlenecks  Her company has won the backing of investors including  Oracle Corp   N ORCL   cofounder Larry Ellison and venture capital firm Draper Fisher Jurvetson   The Journal has stood by its reporting on the company

"By Nandita Bose NEW YORK  Reuters     Target  Corp  N TGT  will offer more deal driven promotions and extend its free shipping window to January this holiday season as it looks to turn around performance in what has so far been a lackluster year for the retailer  Target also expects consumer spending to remain robust in November and December despite uncertainty around the U S  presidential elections  The holiday shopping season is an important time for retailers during which they earn an outsized portion of their annual profits and sales   We are looking at very low unemployment  fuel prices remain low  the commodity pressure on food is down   Chief Executive Officer Brian Cornell told reporters in a meeting on Tuesday   The overall approach for the consumer is going to be positive this season    Improving performance during the holiday months is crucial for Target  After a slow first half of the year  the retailer has warned of flat or slightly lower same store sales for the second half of 2016  as shoppers turn to the internet and spend on big ticket items like cars and home renovations  rather than small  discretionary purchases that make up the bulk of Target s offerings  The Minneapolis based retailer said it will offer more deals this year under its program  Ten Days of Deals   Target will also extend its free shipping offer until Jan  1 this year from Dec  25 last year and drop shipping fees for all online orders for a third year in a row  The retailer currently requires a minimum online order of  25 to qualify for free shipping  Free shipping boosted Target s digital sales growth to over 30 percent during the fourth quarter last year and is a key strategy that allows it to better compete with rivals like Amazon com Inc  O AMZN    Target expects its ship from store program  which it has expanded to 1 000 stores from over 400 last year  to speed up delivery times  The retailer also said it would increase its holiday advertising budget for television  with a special focus on Spanish language programs  as it looks to bring in more Hispanic shoppers  a traditionally strong consumer demographic for Target  
It expects growth to be strong in the home decor  toy and apparel categories  Target will also focus on selling electronic items like the new Apple Watch  In August  the retailer said low demand for Apple Inc  O AAPL  products hurt electronics sales during the second quarter and that it was working with the iPhone maker to capitalize on new product launches "

"By Marius Zaharia  LONDON  Reuters    European shares edged up and the euro hit a one week low against the dollar on Wednesday  driven by upbeat company earnings results and hopes of corporate bond buying by the European Central Bank   Shares in Swiss engineering group ABB gained 3 1 percent after posting a bigger than expected rise in orders  helped by demand from the oil and gas industries  Outdoor equipment maker Husqvarna  ST HUSQb  surged 6 1 percent after reporting a rise in earnings that was above forecasts   The market moves were tentative as investors remain nervous about the state of the global economy  with the euro zone a key soft spot  Such worries may intensify on Thursday when regional business surveys are due   Several sources told Reuters on Tuesday the ECB was considering buying corporate bonds on the secondary market and may make a final decision as soon as December with a view to begin purchases early next year   That would expand the private sector asset buying program the ECB began on Monday with the aim of giving the economy a shot in the arm and safeguarding the euro zone from deflation  which has already gripped five of its 18 members   The FTSEurofirst 300  FTEU3  index of top European shares was up 0 1 percent at 1 300 72 points  after surging 2 1 percent on Tuesday  The euro  hit a one week low of 1 27025 before bouncing to 1 2719  virtually flat on the day    The general takeaway here for a lot of people is that it shows commitment from the ECB trying to find ways to expand its balance sheet  And also it shows     the ECB wanting to pick up the pace   said Paul Robson  a currency strategist at RBS   In the United States  Apple Inc  O AAPL  and Texas Instruments  O TXN  posted stronger than expected quarterly earnings  lifting the tech heavy Nasdaq Composite Index  IXIC  more than 2 percent on Tuesday   That  together with data showing a stronger than expected 2 4 percent rise in U S  domestic home resales last month provided evidence that the U S  economic recovery maintained some momentum    Sentiment turned positive overnight on good earnings reported by U S  corporates  much better than expected U S  existing home sales data and the rumors that the ECB is considering the option of buying corporate bonds in the secondary market   said Daniel Lee at Credit Agricole   Some hopes were also coming from Japan  where trade data showed exports rose 6 9 percent in September from a year earlier  the fastest pace in seven months   INFLATION NEXT  The upbeat signals from the United States bolstered the dollar  although traders were wary of U S  inflation data due at 8 30 a m  EDT   Economists expect annual core CPI inflation to stay flat at 1 7 percent in September  and a cooler reading would add to speculation that the Federal Reserve will wait longer before raising interest rates   The consensus view is that the U S  central bank will decide at its Oct 28 29 policy meeting to wrap up its third round of asset purchases with new money  known as quantitative easing  But short term interest rates futures imply markets do not expect the Fed to hike rates until late 2015   The dollar inched lower on the day against the yen  to 106 88 yen   Euro zone bond yields extended their falls on the back of the ECB s plans  German 10 year Bund yields   which set the standard for euro zone borrowing costs  fell 1 basis point to 0 86 percent  Peripheral bond yields fell by more   
 The news of bond buying had quite a beneficial effect on the non German bond markets  for good reason  so spread narrowing was quite substantial and today there is still some after effect of that   said KBC strategist Piet Lammens     Additional reporting by Jemima Kelly and Michael Urquhart in London and Lisa Twaronite in Tokyo  Editing by Catherine Evans "

"Everyone was hoping that we wouldn t see another plunge like Monday s during this pullback   but the market had a different idea  On Thursday  the Dow dropped by more than 4  and over 1000 points for the second time this week  entering correction territory along with the S P 

Specifically  the Dow lost 4 15   or 1 032 points  to 23 860 5  which is only slightly better than Monday s decline of 4 6   or 1175 points   The NASDAQ fell by 3 9  to 6 777 2 and the S P was off 3 75  to 2581 1 

 Why the nervousness in markets again  Simple  The U S  10 year Treasury prices dropped  pushing their yields to a four year high   said John Blank in Large Cap Trader   Until  unless   the rise in U S  10 year risk free rates stabilize  there is unlikely to be a meaningful pickup in the stock market  

The editors fully expect stocks to regain their footing and climb higher  remember  there s no signs of recession   The problem is that no one knows when that will happen  Therefore  the editors continue to pick up strong stocks at bargain prices while also taking profits where appropriate  We saw both of these types of moves in the portfolios on Thursday 

Today s Portfolio Highlights 

TAZR Trader  This new leg down in the market finally offered the portfolio a chance to buy the NASDAQ 100 3X Bull ETF  TQQQ   which Kevin first tried to fill on Tuesday  The editor is still preparing for the move higher once the weak hands are out  and he wants to be bigger buyers of the so called  FAAMNNG   Facebook  NASDAQ FB   Amazon  NASDAQ AMZN   Apple  NASDAQ AAPL   Microsoft  NASDAQ MSFT   Netflix  NASDAQ NFLX   NVIDIA  NASDAQ NVDA  and Google  NASDAQ GOOGL    These tech juggernauts are holding up rather well in all this volatility  and a 5  position in TQQQ will allow the portfolio to keep its  poles in the water  for the rebound  Make sure to read the last couple of commentaries from Kevin to learn all about the specific support levels in the NASDAQ 100  By the way  the editor also used today s drop to add 5  to the allocation in Lam Research  NASDAQ LRCX  

Insider Trader  Energy stocks are following crude lower  so Tracey felt this was a good time to take some profits out of Helmerich   Payne  NYSE HP   The editor sold half of this contract drilling company on Thursday for a gain of 31 7  in about 5 months  If crude continues to slide  she ll sell the other half  The portfolio also sold Nexeo  NXEO  today for a profit of 4 7  after a  fantastic  quarterly report 

Options Trader   Rough day in the markets  But as we ve been saying  the volatility is here to stay for a while as the markets carve out a new base 

 But this pullback is transitory in my opinion  and I think we re getting close to the end of this correction  if we haven t already seen it  

 The media will over sensationalize the recent pullback  Don t listen  This is normal market behavior after a spectacular  correction free run up over the last two years  This is healthy  I know it feels terrible  All corrections do  But I believe this is just that   a correction in a historic bull market with lots more upside to go  And not the beginning of the end      Kevin Matras

A stall has turned into a power dive on Wall Street  with some bellwether stocks plummeting toward key supports flagged here just a short while ago  One of them  IBM  IBM   actually breached a  midpoint Hidden Pivot  support yesterday at 187 78  and that spells more trouble for investors  The actual low at 185 25 was not far beneath the 187 38 support  but the latter number should have held very precisely if the stock is to avoid yet more carnage  Under the circumstances  IBM looks primed to fall a further  8  to at least 177 56  before it has another chance to get traction Meanwhile  Google  GOOG   another stock whose year end performance will weigh heavily on portfolio managers  bonuses  relapsed to an important Hidden Pivot support of its own at 650 69  We d drum rolled a possible reversal from that number last week  and it came in the form of  20 rally from exactly 650 30  But if Google were about to recover its mojo  the rally should have lasted perhaps 8 12 days  Instead  it appears to have petered out in just a day and a half  strongly hinting of significantly lower prices to come  Our minimum downside projection for the stock is now 605 83  a number you should jot down if you trade this vehicle or hold it as an investment Apple at Cliff s EdgeIf portfolio managers didn t have trouble enough already  Apple  AAPL  was threatening to take another leg down after having fallen nearly 25  since mid September from  705  Now  technically speaking  the stock s best hope for the near term would seem to lie in completing an incipient head and shoulders pattern on the long term chart  The stock is sitting on the right side neckline at the moment  and if the pattern traces out a textbook ending  it could propel Apple into a last gasp rally of as much as  100  But hoping that the pattern continues to develop by the book is like hoping  when your parachute has failed to open  that you ll be able to find a fluffy haystack to land on in the backwoods of New Hampshire A welcome exception to yesterday s weakness was Facebook  FB   a stock in which Rick s Picks subscribers were advised to accumulate March 30 calls at prices ranging from 0 50 down to 0 25  Yesterday  with the Dow Industrials on their way to a 185 loss  our calls doubled in value as Facebook surged  yielding a theoretical gain of 50  over their 0 375 average cost  The underlying stock rallied 2 50  to 22 36  for a one day gain of about 12 5   Terrific as the stock looked  however  we ve warned subscribers not to expect it to continue to swim against the tide  However  our hunch is that even if the Dow were to take a thousand point plunge  the factors that have been pushing Facebook shares higher  whatever they might be  are probably sufficient to put a floor under the stock not far below Winds of WarThere are so many negatives weighing on the stock market right now that it s difficult to single out one of them as the cause of the sharp break since early October  There s Obama s re election  of course  and although that could conceivably push fiscal debt to new extremes  it s not likely to have any economic effect on a deflationary juggernaut that has been gathering force for nearly 30 years  Perhaps the most significant piece of news to have emerged in recent days  overshadowing even headlined rioting in Spain  Portugal and Greece  is the heightened threat of war in the Middle East  In retaliation for the nearly 200 rockets that rained down on southern Israel from Gaza a few days ago  Israel took out Hamas  military chief officer and a few others with some air strikes  Things took a turn for the worse  diplomatically speaking  when Egypt yesterday recalled its ambassador from Tel Aviv  Israel has warned that any Hamas operative who shows his face above ground is as good as dead  For its part  Hamas has threatened to step up the rocket attacks Petraeus  Who Cares Meanwhile  the same individuals in the news media who took a see no evil  hear no evil approach toward scandal before the election are tripping over themselves to expose every sordid detail of Petraeus s love afffair  Will the headline orgy cease when it threatens to engulf Obama himself  Who cares  Whatever happens  we ll stay focused on Gaza while tuning out all distractions related to the so called fiscal cliff  As we all absolutely  positively know  the shiftless dorkwads we ve elected to Congress are only going to kick the can further down the road when it comes time to fix the budget If war is about to break out in the Mideast and become above the fold news in America  the so far 1120 point drop in the Dow Average since early October would not even begin to discount the economic damage that will come in its wake

Value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment  After all  who wouldn t want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys  or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios  many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process  Let s put PacWest Bancorp   NASDAQ PACW   stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value oriented investors right now  or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks PE RatioA key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio  or PE for short  This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock  and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world  The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock s current PE ratio with  a  where this ratio has been in the past  b  how it compares to the average for the industry sector  and c  how it compares to the market as a whole On this front  PacWest has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 16 75  as you can see in the chart below This level actually compares pretty favorably with the market at large  as the PE for the S P 500 compares in at about 20 15  If we focus on the stock s long term PE trend  the current level puts PacWest s current PE ratio somewhat below its midpoint  which is 17 48  over the past five years Further  the stock s PE also compares favorably with the Zacks classified Banks   West industry s trailing twelve months PE ratio  which stands at 19 26  At the very least  this indicates that the stock is relatively undervalued right now  compared to its peers We should also point out that PacWest has a forward PE ratio  price relative to this year s earnings  of 16 04  so it is fair to say that a slightly more value oriented path may be ahead for PacWest stock in the near term too PEG RatioWhile earnings are certainly important  it is essential to know how much you are paying for the growth of earnings as well  One can easily do that with the PEG ratio  ratio of the P E to the expected future earnings growth rate  The PEG ratio gives a more complete picture of the valuation of a stock than the P E ratio PacWest s PEG ratio stands at just 1 51  compared with the Zacks Banks   West industry average of 1 65  This suggests a decent undervalued trading relative to its earnings growth potential right now Broad Value OutlookIn aggregate  PacWest currently has a Zacks Value Style Score of  B   putting it into the top 40  of all stocks we cover from this look  This makes PACW a solid choice for value investors  and some of its other key metrics make this pretty clear too For example  its P CF ratio  another great indicator of value  comes in at 9 07  which is considerably better than the industry average of 14 85  Clearly  PACW is a solid choice on the value front from multiple angles What About the Stock Overall Though PacWest might be a good choice for value investors  there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name  In particular  it is worth noting that the company has a Growth grade of  D  and a Momentum score of  D   This gives PACW a Zacks VGM score or its overarching fundamental grade of  D    You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores  Meanwhile  the company s recent earnings estimates have been disappointing  The current quarter has seen one estimate go higher in the past sixty days and three lower  while the full year estimate has seen one upward and four downward revisions in the same time period This has had a noticeable impact on the consensus estimate  as the current quarter consensus estimate has fallen by 1 3  in the past two months  while the full year estimate has declined 2 3   You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action for the stock in the chart below PacWest Bancorp Price and Consensus    This bearish trend is why the stock has just a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  and why we are looking for in line performance from the company in the near term Bottom LinePacWest is an inspired choice for value investors  as it is hard to beat its incredible lineup of statistics on this front  However  despite a good industry rank  top 10  out of more than 250 industries   a Zacks Rank  3  makes it hard to get too excited about this company overall  Nonetheless  over the past one year  the Zacks Banks West sector has significantly outperformed the broader market  as you can see below So  value investors might want to wait for estimates and analyst sentiment to turn around in this name first  but once that happens  this stock could be a compelling pick More Stock News  8 Companies Verge on Apple Like RunDid you miss Apple  NASDAQ AAPL  s 9X stock explosion after they launched their iPhone in 2007

"Immersion Corporation  NASDAQ IMMR 
Immersion Corporation  IMMR   a global haptic technology company yesterday reported their fourth quarter and full year 2016 financial results  Immersion reported fourth quarter adjusted earnings of a loss of  0 27 per share which fell short of analyst expectations of a loss of  0 17 per share  Immersion reported fourth quarter revenues of  9 3 million which fell short of analyst expectations of  10 3 million 
IMMR Technical Analysis

IMMR opened trading yesterday at  10 96 which was down from the previous day s trading close of  11 15  Shares closed trading yesterday at  10 69 and spiked down after market to  8 92  equivalent to a 17  decrease from the closing price  Taking a look at the daily chart we can see that the last time IMMR traded below these levels we have to go all the way back to November 8th 2016  when it traded at  8 86 
Taking a closer look at the daily chart we can see that before the spike down IMMR had already been in an overall downward trend dating back to February 21st  2016 when it traded at  11 67  IMMR has a float of 18 45 million shares and traded 1 30 times the normal daily trading volume on Thursday 
For trading purposes  I would like to see IMMR open trading on Friday below  9 50 and if it does I would be looking to take a short position at the bell  My stop loss would be  0 20 from my entry position fearing anything more than that and the stock would start to fill in the gap down 
Immersion Corporation CEO s Comments

 2016 was a year of exciting innovation  with wide spread adoption of haptics across all of our target markets and a broadening of our customer base   said Vic Viegas  chief executive officer of Immersion   We are pleased with our fiscal year results  having achieved our goals for both revenue and non GAAP net income during a year in which it was also critical that we dedicate resources and attention to protecting and preserving our intellectual property  We remain focused on leveraging our three key strategic assets   our culture of innovation  our haptic know how and our broad patent portfolio  as we continue to execute on our long term plan of driving broad adoption of our haptic technologies across existing and emerging markets 
We exit the year with a strong and healthy balance sheet  which enables us to continue to execute on our strategic objectives  We remain focused on the importance of defending the value of our 20  years of innovation  and protecting the interests of our stakeholders  In the near term  we recognize that there will be some trade offs with regards to financial performance as we vigorously defend our IP  In addition to normal considerations  our guidance for 2017 takes into account the ongoing litigation with Apple  NASDAQ AAPL  and the current unlicensed status of Samsung  KS 005930  
Even with these considerations  we expect 2017 revenues of  38 million to  42 million  reflecting base business growth of roughly flat to 11  excluding the recognition in 2016 of  19 million in wind down rights from Samsung for products that were licensed under Immersion s prior agreement  Non GAAP net loss for 2017 is expected to be  23 million to  32 million  or   0 76  to   1 05  per diluted share  Looking ahead  we are confident that our innovative solutions and IP increasingly will be recognized as a  must have  by existing and new customers  leading to measurable value creation and growth prospects in 2017 and beyond   concluded Mr  Viegas

"Investing com   Here s a look at three things that were under the radar this past week 
1  China in Danger of a Double Dip in Growth 
While much of the focus has been on the U S  economy and the possibility the Federal Reserve will dive in with interest rate cuts to keep growth going  investors shouldn t ignore the other side of the big trade dispute 
China is in danger of a double dip in slowing growth  Morgan Stanley said this week 
Citing trade tensions Morgan Stanley has already cut its fourth quarter China GDP forecast by 20 basis points to an annual rate of 6 4  from 6 6   It also cut its full year 2019 forecast to 6 4  from 6 5  
The country posted a surprise first quarter growth rate of 6 4   holding steady from the fourth quarter of 2018 and topping forecasts for GDP growth of 6 3   That followed third quarter 2018 growth of 6 5  and second quarter growth of 6 7  
But with the trade war  there s the possibility of growth dipping down again 
 The time window for China and the U S  to address trade tensions is narrowing   Morgan Stanley analysts said in a research note   If trade talks stall post G20  we see further downside risks to growth  
 If the US imposes 25  tariffs on the remaining  approximately  US 300 billion of imports from China  China s GDP growth could decelerate to 6 0  in 2019 despite more aggressive stimulus  with quarterly growth dropping below 6 0   annually  by 2H19  
With regard to the new tariffs  President Donald Trump said Thursday he  will make that decision in the next two weeks after the G20  
 I will be meeting with President Xi  Jinping  and we ll see what happens  we re probably planning it sometime after G20   Trump said 
2  Powell Pivot Not the Only Reason Stocks Will Remain in Vogue
Friday s rally in stocks on a weak U S  jobs report marked a throwback to the post crisis era  when signs of economic woes were met with cheers amid expectations the Fed would show up and ease  ease  ease 
But even if the Fed fails to deliver a rate cut  stocks will likely remain hot as the plunge in Treasury yields leaves investors with little choice to go elsewhere  analysts say 
The 10 year Treasury yield slumped to a 21 month low of 2 065  on Friday  falling below the average dividend return of an S P 500 stock at 2 078   More than 44  of S P 500 stocks yield more than 10 year government bonds  according to FactSet 
Keith Lerner  chief market strategist at SunTrust Advisory Services  told MarketWatch that it was  unusual  that the 10 year   yield is so close to the S P 500 
 With yields this low  you don t even have to be particularly optimistic about the economy  to buy equities  he added 
The spread between the 3 month bill yield and the 10 year note yield stood at about negative 17 basis points  continuing an inversion of the yield curve that resurfaced weeks ago 
 They ve been driven largely by trade   and  maybe some other risk off factors   said Michael Schumacher  managing director and global head of rate strategy at Wells Fargo Securities 
 But it s really that deviation between the Fed on the very front end and risk off concerns on the back end  That s why the curve is inverted in our view  and that s why we think it s not really a recession predictor at this point  
3  Monopoly Pricing Doesn t Equal Inflation
The issue of market competition came to the fore recently with signs that the government may move to curb the dominance of tech powerhouses like Apple  NASDAQ AAPL  and Google  NASDAQ GOOGL  
This week the Richmond Fed issued a report on whether markets were less competitive  As with most complex  hot button issues  a definitive conclusion wasn t reached  with the Richmond Fed saying the explanations of market concentration and price markups don t all  point to a commensurate increase in market power  
But also in the report was a good explanation for rate watchers on how monopolistic companies boosting markups  the ratio between price and cost  wouldn t necessarily raise inflation concerns at the central bank 
 Inflation is a measure of rising prices generally  but markups measure how much individual firms set prices above their costs   the Richmond Fed said   Thus  it is possible for markups to rise because firms facing little competition are able to set prices high or because efficient firms have found ways to reduce their costs while keeping prices stable  
 It also may be difficult to discern a connection between markups and inflation if the Fed is pursuing monetary policy that offsets inflationary pressure from markups   it added 
Still a  recent study found that  the welfare costs of markups are large   primarily because they act as a tax on output   the Richmond Fed said "

	While the indices never made an attempt to reach the green  they did come off their lows by the close  The NASDAQ  though  was still down by 1 11  to 7085 68 
	We re getting ready for a lot of big tech reports starting with Apple  NASDAQ AAPL  after the close tomorrow  along with Microsoft  NASDAQ MSFT   Amazon  NASDAQ AMZN  and Facebook  NASDAQ FB  in the following days  So the market wasn t too thrilled that such a week began with graphics chip leader NVIDIA cutting its fourth quarter revenue guidance  Remember  this comes less than a month after Apple lowered its Q1 guidance amid weak iPhone sales in China  
	On the other end of the market  Caterpillar s weaker than expected earnings wreaked havoc with the Dow and sent it lower by well over 300 points at its worst  However  it recouped a bit and was off by only 0 84   or about 209 points  to 24 528 22  The Dow and the NASDAQ are on five week winning streaks  but now they ll need to dig out of a hole to keep that rally going 
	The S P slipped 0 78  to 2643 85 
	Overall  though  earnings season has been solid so far  However  its biggest test comes this week with three of the four remaining FAANGs heading to the plate  There will also be other industrial names reporting  such as 3M  NYSE MMM  tomorrow 
	As we near the end of January  we should take a step back and really appreciate what the market has accomplished in the past 5 weeks  Remember how sour the sentiment was in December  Since then  stocks have gotten back most of what they lost in the correction  But the exuberance has mellowed a bit of late and we ve been seeing a lot of choppy sessions  We re going to need good earnings reports and  eventually  a trade deal to spark the next leg higher Today s Portfolio Highlights Surprise Trader  Whether on the ground or in the air  Dave has you covered this earnings season  On Monday  the editor added a pair of transportation names with 12 5  allocations each  ArcBest  ARCB  is a Zacks Rank  2  Buy  trucking company with a positive Earnings ESP of 4 78  for the quarter coming after the bell this Wednesday  The other buy is Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  airline Skywest  SKYW   which hasn t missed earnings since August 2014  Given its positive Earnings ESP of 2 7   Dave thinks this impressive streak will continue when SKYW reports again after the bell on January 31  Read the full write up for more on these new buys Options Trader  The portfolio is going to the movies by adding a few calls in Cinemark  CNK   a Zacks Rank  2  Buy  motion picture exhibition leader that operates 4 600 screens in 408 theaters  The stock may finally be ready to break out to the upside after building a bullish basing pattern over the past four years  The company has a positive Earnings ESP of 10 12  for the report coming on February 22  but Kevin thinks this stock will be moving higher in the runup to the announcement  Ultimately  the editor s longer term price target for the stock is  62 50  On Monday  he bought to open three September 40 00 Calls in CNK  Read more in the full write up  Black Box Trader  The portfolio had five winners out of the six stocks that were deleted in this week s adjustment  Those positions that left today were

"The   but competition is steeper than ever for Apple   NASDAQ AAPL     Samsung   OTC SSNLF   and other cell phone manufacturers are nipping at the heels of the Cupertino giant  and investors have  with regards to holding onto its large market share in the smartphone industry  
Improved battery life  water resistance  more memory  and a better camera make the iPhone 7 a notable upgrade from the iPhone 6s   However  there are reasons for why many of my iPhone wielding friends  who are in their 20s  will be opting out of upgrading to the iPhone 7 
No Headphone Jack
Most people have heard about this by now  but I ll say it anyways   The  that you ve been accustomed to seeing on pretty much every smartphone over the last decade   The device does ship with wireless headphones called AirPods  and they also come with an adaptor  but it has a rectangular Lightning connector  
The problem that arises with this is that users will not be able to charge their phones while listening to music  or making calls  with wired headphones that have a Lightning connector    You could get a dongle that lets you use wired headphones while charging  but that s another  40 dollars which you d have to shell out 
Furthermore  most headphones use 3 5mm jacks to connect  and this is still a very popular way of listening to music since you get better sound quality without having to worry about the battery life of your headphones   While Bluetooth technology can help in dodging problems associated with a jack less iPhone 7  sound quality is often sacrificed   This is a big deal for some of my millennial peers  and it is a viable reason for why they won t be upgrading to  flagship device         
Looks like the iPhone 6 
Now  the iPhone 7 is a great phone across most specs and it is also a clear upgrade from the iPhone 6   We ve established this  and while the internals are different  Apple failed to give the exterior a complete makeover   In fact  the iPhone 7 s height  width  and depth are exactly the same as the iPhone 6s  5 44 by 2 64 by 0 28 inches    The Lightning connector is in the same place  but the phone now sports a home button that s no longer physical 
Apple made a bold choice by going with a design that is very similar to its last smartphone  but users stand to feel disappointed by the lack of design change   In Naperville  a town close to where I live  everyone seems to have an iPhone   I was hanging out with a group of my friends in Naperville over the weekend and I asked them if they were excited about upgrading to the iPhone 7  
Not surprisingly  most of them were put off by the fact that the phone doesn t look like much of a sequel to the iPhone 6 on the surface   They are hardcore Apple fans  but they worry about the phone not feeling or looking like much of an upgrade when they hold it   Like my friends  I also appreciate the aesthetic physical qualities in any new phone or device I buy   I also admit that when I upgrade  I do take pride in receiving something that looks like a distinctly unique product 
Waiting for the iPhone 8
While the iPhone 7 boasts new hardware upgrades compared to its predecessor  the device seems like more of an incremental upgrade as opposed to being a big step forward for Apple   Some speculate that the iPhone 7 s similar design to the iPhone 6 shows that Apple is planning on making bigger changes for its next phone  
This could give people reason to wait longer  and this is troubling since there is an ongoing trend of smartphone users waiting longer before replacing their phones   Apple has previously done well in getting its users to upgrade their phones to the next version available  but it may now run into a problem that many other cell phone manufacturers face    
Yesterday  my friend said that she is waiting for the iPhone 8 because her iPhone 6 is already great   The specs of the iPhone 7 didn t convince her that an upgrade was worth it  but she heard that the iPhone 8 would boast a large screen that takes up the entire front of the phone   I have also heard this rumor and I think that this would definitely be an innovative feature since it hasn t been tried yet
2017 will be the 10th anniversary of the iPhone  and many speculate that Apple will really kick things up a notch when it reveals its next phone   Although the timeline dictates that this would be the time where Apple releases the  s  version of its phone  it may skip that version altogether  similar to how Samsung jumped right from the Galaxy Note 5 to the  
Bottom Line
I am not saying that millennials won t buy the iPhone 7   I am simply relaying my experiences to show the thought process behind why some younger people will choose to opt out of upgrading their iPhone 6 to Apple s latest phone 
From its simplicity to its exclusivity  there are many things that millennials appreciate about the iPhone and Apple s brand   Unfortunately  there are a few let downs which could negatively impact how Apple s latest phone resonates with younger consumers   Right now  Apple is a Zacks Rank  3  Hold

lead to strong economic growth and is thus a boon for the stock market Additionally  rising oil price driven by the extension in OPEC output cut deal  supply threats and shrinking inventories are providing a solid boost  Further  recovery in the U S  housing market as well as the flurry of M A deals bode well for the stock market  Moreover  the American economy is on a growth path  albeit at a

Value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment  After all  who wouldn t want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys  or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios  many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process  Let s put The Western Union Company   NYSE WU   stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value oriented investors right now  or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks PE RatioA key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio  or PE for short  This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock  and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world  The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock s current PE ratio with  a  where this ratio has been in the past  b  how it compares to the average for the industry sector  and c  how it compares to the market as a whole On this front  Western Union has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 11 42  as you can see in the chart below This level actually compares pretty favorably with the market at large  as the PE for the S P 500 stands at about 20 19  If we focus on the long term PE trend  Western Union s current PE level puts it on par with its midpoint over the past five years Further  the stock s PE also compares favorably with the Zacks classified Financial Transaction Services industry s trailing twelve months PE ratio  which stands at 26 45  At the very least  this indicates that the stock is relatively undervalued right now  compared to its peers We should also point out that Western Union has a forward PE ratio  price relative to this year s earnings  of just 11 35  so it is fair to say that a slightly more value oriented path may be ahead for Western Union stock in the near term too P S RatioAnother key metric to note is the Price Sales ratio  This approach compares a given stock s price to its total sales  where a lower reading is generally considered better  Some people like this metric more than other value focused ones because it looks at sales  something that is far harder to manipulate with accounting tricks than earnings Right now  Western Union has a P S ratio of about 1 71  This is lower than the S P 500 average  which comes in at 3 12 right now  Also  as we can see in the chart below  this is well below the highs for this stock in particular over the past few years If anything  this suggests some level of undervalued trading at least compared to historical norms Broad Value OutlookIn aggregate  Western Union currently has a Zacks Value Style Score of  B   putting it into the top 40  of all stocks we cover from this look  This makes Western Union a solid choice for value investors  and some of its other key metrics make this pretty clear too For example  the company s P CF ratio  another great indicator of value  comes in at 10 62  which is far better than the industry average of 14 88  Clearly  WU is a solid choice on the value front from multiple angles What About the Stock Overall Though Western Union might be a good choice for value investors  there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name  In particular  it is worth noting that the company has a Growth grade of  B  and a Momentum score of  D   This gives WU a Zacks VGM score or its overarching fundamental grade of  B    You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores  Meanwhile  the company s recent earnings estimates have been mixed at best  The current quarter has seen two upward estimate revision in the past sixty days compared to four downward  while the full year estimate has seen two upward and five downward revisions in the same time frame As a result  the current quarter consensus estimate has remained stable in the past two month  while the full year estimate has decreased by 1 2   You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action for the stock in the chart below Western Union Company  The  Price and Consensus   This somewhat mixed trend is why the stock has just a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  and why we are looking for in line performance from the company in the near term Bottom LineWestern Union may an inspired choice for value investors  as it is hard to beat its incredible lineup of statistics on this front  However  with a sluggish industry rank  Bottom 43   and a Zacks Rank  3  it is hard to get too excited about this company overall So  value investors might want to wait for estimates and analyst sentiment to turn around in this name first  but once that happens  this stock could be a compelling pick More Stock News  8 Companies Verge on Apple Like RunDid you miss Apple  NASDAQ AAPL  s 9X stock explosion after they launched their iPhone in 2007  Now 2017 looks to be a pivotal year to get in on another emerging technology expected to rock the market  Demand could soar from almost nothing to  42 billion by 2025  Reports suggest it could save 10 million lives per decade which could in turn save  200 billion in U S  healthcare costs A bonus Zacks Special Report names this breakthrough and the 8 best stocks to exploit it  Like Apple in 2007  these companies are already strong and coiling for potential mega gains 
"The most anticipated report of the entire earnings season will be released after today s closing bell  The number of estimates for   O AAPL  have already blown away last quarter s record of 607  currently at 924 for the fiscal fourth quarter vs  the sell side which only has around 40 estimates  Recall that last quarter Apple reported EPS of  1 85  just one cent short of the Estimize consensus yet a nickel above the Street s consensus 

This quarter the crowd is calling for EPS of  1 91 vs  Wall Street s  1 88  signaling YoY growth of 34   Revenues are anticipated to come in at  51 359B as compared to Wall Street s estimate for  50 798B  a 22  growth rate  In addition to earnings and revenues  here are the other areas to watch later today 
iPhone 6s and 6s Plus sales
Investors will be waiting with great anticipation to hear how sales of the iPhone 6s and 6s Plus are faring  Three days after the official launch in late September  Apple sold more than 13 million units in one weekend  a company record  This is up from the 10 million units that were sold during the first weekend of the iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus launch  This quarter s report will only include the Friday and Saturday sales of that record breaking weekend  as the fiscal quarter officially ended on September 25 
Continued growth in China 
Much of the company s success this year can be attributed to China  but can massive growth in that region continue  Earlier this year Apple received approval from Chinese regulators to sell iPhones  During its fiscal Q2 2015 report back in April  Apple reported that iPhone sales in China outpaced the U S  for the first time ever  In the latest quarterly report released in July  YoY growth in Greater China was up 112   with nearly 30  of total revenues coming from the region  The latest iPhone models were made available in China on launch day  something that wasn t true of the iPhone 6 iPhone 6 Plus release 
Despite success in China  Apple needs to continue diversifying its revenue streams by geography  The growth in the Chinese middle and upper classes has bolstered purchases of iPhones  now seen as a status symbol  While the company is working through its plans to expand into 40 additional countries this month  including Italy  Mexico and Spain  it seems the most untapped potential lies in India  However  the multitude of less expensive smartphone options creates a more challenging environment for the iPhone as it is likely out of the price range most are willing to spend in that country 
Update on other products  Apple Watch  Pay  Music  and TV
Investors will also be looking for updates on several of Apple s other products this quarter that have recently been launched or are in the process of being launched  These products are likely going to help Apple reduce its reliance on its iPhone segment  which currently dictates around 70  of revenues 
The much anticipated Apple Watch was released in April this year and is expected to bolster revenue growth in the years to come as the smart wearable device market continues to grow  The company has not given any indication on how the Watch has done in its last two reports  grouping it into its  Other products  segment which includes devices such as the iPod  Beats and others  making individual product sales difficult to track  However  that segment increased 56  in the latest report after putting up dismal numbers in the prior two quarters  attributed in part to Apple Watch sales 
Apple has also continued its aggressive strategy to offer its Apple Pay product across various geographies  Apple recently launched Apple Pay in the United Kingdom  offering its services through a range of banks and payment systems including American Express  N AXP  and the Royal Bank of Scotland  L RBS   Apple also plans on penetrating other markets such as Canada and China in the near term 
Apple recently entered the highly crowded streaming music space with its introduction of Apple Music  Although it just launched in June  it seems the service is already stealing market share from competitors such as   N P  which blamed a revenue miss and loss of subscribers in the third quarter to the rise of Apple Music on their earnings call last week 
Finally  the latest version of Apple TV just became available to order  with first shipments arriving on October 30  The fourth generation of the product will first be launched in the US  UK  Canada and Australia  with 80 more launch countries to follow  This comes at a time when rumors are flying that the tech giant is in talks with networks to offer a subscription TV service of about 25 channels  Investors will be interested to hear how this product is progressing and more details surrounding the competitive strategy "

Constant conflict between Boeing   NYSE BA   and international air safety authorities has been threatening the return of the jet behemoth s 737 Max fleet to service  The latest discord between the Federal Aviation Administration  FAA  and European Union Aviation Safety Agency  EASA  regarding the re certification of this fleet has compounded its woes Notably  EASA declared that it will determine whether 737 Max is fit for flying  which reflects its lack of confidence in FAA s decision  With the holiday season approaching  such discrepancy between the two major global regulators may further delay 737 s return  This also poses a risk for airline stocks  which are already bearing the brunt of the grounding of Boeing s best selling airliner since March Reason Behind the ConflictPer media sources  a briefing by Boeing this August was cut short  with regulators from the United States  Europe  Brazil and elsewhere complaining about the jet maker s failure to provide technical details and answer specific questions about modifications in the operation of MAX flight control computers  Specifically  these regulators demanded that Boeing resubmitted briefing documents  describing proposed software changes  which will then be vetted by the FAA However  per a recent release  EASA  which is conducting its own independent review of the grounded 737 Max  has listed a few requirements  which are much more stringent than those of its U S  counterpart  Now  if FAA clears 737 Max for flight and EASA delays the same  then the aircraft will be allowed only for domestic flights within the United States  In that case  U S  airlines operating internationally as well as international airlines that operate 737 Max will continue to suffer   In fact  per a Reuters report  other international regulators have also indicated that they will conduct their own analysis of 737 MAX and Boeing s proposed updates  after the FAA s credibility took a hit following 737 MAX crashes What s the Status of the Airline Industry While the grounding of 737 Max has been a notable drag on Boeing s share price  airlines that have a substantial number of 737 Max jets in their fleet are also incurring significant losses over the past several months  In particular  the commercial damage for airline operators appears to have reached the highest level during the peak summer season Per a report by U K  based flight data information firm OAG  Boeing 737 Max s grounding is estimated to hurt global airline industry revenues by  4 1 billion in 2019  including  600 million for three U S  airlines that fly the aircraft Boeing initially expected to get the re certification for 737 Max by late September  This would have brought the fleet to service by October   But considering the latest developments  it is highly unlikely  With the holiday season coming up  further delay in the return of 737 Max will prove to be a drag for the airline industry Airline Stocks in FocusFollowing are the airline stocks that have been suffering the most due to the grounding of 737 Max  As further delay is anticipated in the return of this jetliner to service  we urge investors to keep an eye on these stocks   Southwest Airlines   NYSE LUV    which operates the world s largest fleet of 737 Max planes  has decided to remove Boeing 737 MAX jets from its schedule until Jan 5  2020  Per Bloomberg  the grounding cut  225 million from this airlines  2019 operating income American Airlines   NASDAQ AAL   extended grounding of the 737 Max fleet until Dec 3 as a result of which approximately 140 flights will be cancelled per day  In July  the company reported that the grounding has already resulted in loss of  185 million in revenues  which per OAG might reach  220 million by the end of 2019 United Continental Holdings   NASDAQ UAL   has extended grounding of its 737 Max fleet to Dec 19   According to a CNBC report  this is anticipated to result in 93 flights being cancelled per day in November and 96 a day in the Dec 1 18 period  Though there are no estimates for revenue loss yet  it is obvious that the grounding will have an adverse impact More Stock News  This Is Bigger than the iPhone It could become the mother of all technological revolutions  Apple  NASDAQ AAPL  sold a mere 1 billion iPhones in 10 years but a new breakthrough is expected to generate more than 27 billion devices in just 3 years  creating a  1 7 trillion market Zacks has just released a Special Report that spotlights this fast emerging phenomenon and 6 tickers for taking advantage of it  If you don t buy now  you may kick yourself in 2020

"Cisco   NASDAQ CSCO   shares surged over 7  in morning trading Thursday on the back of a stronger than expected quarterly financial report after the closing bell Wednesday  The maker of switches  routers  and other hardware used to connect computers and communication services provided solid guidance amid increased U S  and China trade war worries 
Quick Earnings Overview  
Cisco posted adjusted Q3 fiscal 2019 earnings of  0 78 per share  This marked an 18  jump from the year ago period and beat our  0 77 a share Zacks Consensus Estimate  Investors should note that Cisco has an impressive history of quarterly earnings beats  which means Wall Street might have already priced in an earnings beat  Therefore  the tech giant s 4  revenue growth  which also topped our estimates  could have pushed the stock up Thursday morning CSCO s revenue popped 6  when normalized for divestments   
Furthermore  Cisco provided strong Q4 fiscal 2019 earnings guidance of between  0 80 and  0 82 per share  which came in above our  0 80 estimate  The company also expects its fourth quarter revenue to grow between 4 5  to 6 5   Overall  Cisco showed that its transformation into a more diverse and modern tech firm has continued to pay off 
Shares of CSCO had climbed roughly 7 15  to  56 19 per share through morning trading  just off its 52 week intraday highs of  57 53  Overall  Cisco stock is up over 30  in 2019 to top its industry s 19  average climb and the S P 500 s 13  
Stepping back further  investors should know that Cisco shares have outpaced its industry s average over the past five years and crushed its peer group s nearly sideways movement  which includes the likes of NetGear   NASDAQ NTGR   and Motorola   NYSE MSI    Furthermore  CSCO has topped Google s   NASDAQ GOOGL   120  climb over this stretch and Apple s   NASDAQ AAPL   121  expansion 
 
 
Outlook  China Impac   Huawei 
As we mentioned earlier  the historic San Jose  California headquartered firm now sells everything from security offerings to solutions for cloud computing  data centers  the Internet of Things  and more  Of course  much of Cisco s business still surrounds routers and switches  However  only a small percentage of its sales come from China and the firm has addressed Trump s previous 10  tariffs and is ready for the increased 25  duties as well 
 We still have some manufacturing happening in China  but we have greatly  greatly reduced our exposure working with our supply chain and our suppliers   CFO Kelly Kramer said on the company s earnings call when asked how new higher tariffs would impact Cisco   We have incorporated in the guide that we gave for Q4 and we think we can manage through that  Of course  we ll be watching that as the quarter goes on  
On top of the tariffs directly related to the U S  and China trade dispute  Trump recently issued an  declaring a national emergency preventing U S  companies from using information and communications technology equipment from sources that  poses an unacceptable risk to the national security of the United States  
The basic idea here is that the U S  is trying to prevent the expansion of Huawei Technologies Co  around the globe because of its close ties to the Chinese government  Huawei is one of Cisco s biggest rivals  which could be good for Cisco if we put aside the uncertain geopolitical implications for now  also read    What could hurt Cisco is a broader economic downturn caused  in part  by the U S  Chinese trade war as its offerings are often seen as an indicator of overall corporate health and spending  Clearly  many companies in both the U S  and China would face tough times ahead if the ongoing fight lasts much longer  This is why some analysts and economists believe some type of resolution between the world s two largest economies is likely 
 
 
Bottom Line
Our current Zacks Consensus Estimates call for the company s adjusted full year earnings to surge 17 7  on the back of 4 7  revenue growth  Peeking further ahead  Cisco s fiscal 2020 EPS figure is projected to climb 10 5  above our current year estimate on 3 4  higher revenues  These projections could  of course  change as more analysts update their estimates following its strong Q3 2019 earnings release 
Along with these solid top and bottom line growth estimates  we can see that Cisco s valuation picture appears a bit stretched compared to where it has traded over the last decade  Yet  CSCO s forward P E ratio of 17 6X comes in below its 10 year high of 20 2X and we can t forget that the firm s stock price has climbed over the last five years  especially in relation to its industry  which helps justify its higher price to earnings ratio 
Plus  Cisco currently pays a  0 35 quarterly dividend  for a 2 67  yield  This represents a 6  increase from last year and a 20  improvement on a two year stack  Cisco is a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  that sports  B  grades for Value  Growth  and Momentum in our Style Scores system  Clearly  CSCO seems like a stock to consider as the company plays a key roll in the expansion of computers  internet  and other connectivity services  And it seems set to diversify  as it tries to navigate the current global economic uncertainty

As the current earnings season comes to a close  it s about time to look back on the best reports from the leaders in gaming  We saw great results from several companies  but let s dig a bit deeper to see if there s a clear winner 
It should be noted that video game publishing companies have changed the way they report their non GAAP fiscal results to meet stricter guidelines imposed by the SEC  
Activision Blizzard
Activision Blizzard   NASDAQ ATVI    the publisher of franchises like Call of Duty  Overwatch  and Starcraft  reported better than expected results on the top and bottom lines last week  The company posted adjusted earnings of 31 cents per share  beating Street estimates of 22 cents  Adjusted revenue of  1 196 also beat Street estimates of  1 103 billion 
Activision Blizzard s net revenues presented in accordance with GAAP were up 19  to a Q1 record of  1 73 billion  The company s GAAP net revenues from digital channels were up 50  to  1 39 billion  Activision Blizzard now expects adjusted Q2 net revenues of  1 2 billion and earnings per share of  0 27 
 Among the drivers of our results was Overwatch  which now has over 30 million players globally  The Overwatch League is gaining momentum and we re excited to offer our community of players the best professional league experience   said Activision Blizzard CEO Bobby Kotick 
Investors should note that Activision Blizzard s impressive results this quarter came despite a lack of a blockbuster release  and the company is still set to debut Destiny 2 and Call of Duty  WWII later this year  Also  it was interesting that Kotick specifically mentioned the company s new Overwatch League  as it underscores how seriously these companies are taking esports  also read    
Shares of ATVI are up just over 4  since the release of this report 
Electronic Arts
Electronic Arts   NASDAQ EA   publishes marquee games like Battlefield  Star Wars  Battlefront  and Fifa  The company posted its fourth quarter fiscal 2017 results on Tuesday afternoon 
On a GAAP basis  revenues were up 16 7  to  1 527 billion  GAAP digital revenues grew 30 6  to  934 million  Full game downloads revenues were up 70  to  259 million  mobile games increased 9  year over year to  165 million  and subscriptions  advertising and others increased 20  to  113 million 
GAAP earnings came in at  1 81 per share  beating GAAP analyst estimates of  1 63  GAAP revenues also beat analyst expectations of  1 49 billion 
Adjusted for deferrals  revenue came in at  1 092 billion  slightly lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  1 093 billion  also read    
EA said that it expects the  live services components  of franchises like Battlefield  Fifa  and Star Wars to emerge as significant growth catalysts  The company guided for GAAP revenues of  1 425 billion and earnings of  1 93 next quarter 
Shares of EA are up more than 14  following the release of its report 
NVIDIA Corporation
Although Nvidia   NASDAQ NVDA   is not a games publisher and therefore not a direct competitor of Activision and EA the company specifically designs high end graphics processing units  GPUs  for the PC gaming market 
Nvidia posted adjusted earnings  including stock based compensation but excluding other one time items  on a proportionate tax basis of 82 cents per share  beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 66 cents  This figure also represented EPS growth of more than 110   also read    
Revenues of  1 937 billion were up 48 4  and beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  1 910 billion  Revenues from its GPU business were up 45  to  1 56 billion  driven by growth in the GeForce GPUs Gaming division  The Gaming GPU segment was up 49  on a year over year basis 
Shares of NVDA soared more than 14  after the earnings release 
Bottom Line
The video game industry isn t perfect  and some are still considered about the demand for traditional outlets  but this season s results highlighted the strength throughout the industry 
Despite all of the changes throughout the industry  we can still judge video game stocks by the strength of their sales and the company s ability to effectively cash in on the latest gaming trends

"By Caroline Valetkevitch NEW YORK  Reuters    Investors are losing faith that a U S  China trade deal could happen soon and are bracing their portfolios for a more prolonged battle that could hamper global growth  An escalation in recent days in the long running trade dispute between the world s two biggest economies has stoked fears of a global economic slowdown  causing a sell off in stocks led by trade sensitive names and a move into low risk assets like U S  Treasuries and gold  China on Monday said it would impose tariffs ranging from 5  to 25  on 5 140 U S  products on a target list worth about  60 billion from June 1  striking back after the United States raised duties last week  Investors have begun to adjust their investment outlooks to factor in more uncertainty on the trade front  at least for the near term   You re seeing see a move toward more defensive companies and companies that can still deliver cash flow and dividends   said Quincy Krosby  chief market strategist at Prudential Financial  NYSE PRU  in Newark  New Jersey  These adjustments will continue after Monday  she said   There s more to this   Among concerns for stock investors  a collapse of U S  China trade discussions could hurt the earnings outlook  Investors expect tariffs could lift corporate costs and lower profit margins  while continued uncertainty surrounding a trade deal will hinder the ability of companies to plan or make capital expenditures  The sudden change in sentiment could cause some investors to move to cash as well  some strategists said    I wouldn t be surprised if some people are raising cash too   said Michael O Rourke  chief market strategist at JonesTrading in Greenwich  Connecticut   The market is starting to realize the situation is as bad as it could be   Optimism that the United States was close to a trade deal with China had been one of the pillars of this year s stock market rally  The S P 500 returned to record highs in recent weeks and is still up 12 2  since Dec  31   Investor expectations that the Federal Reserve will hold off on raising interest rates for now and that the economy will remain stable have supported stocks as well and kept trade relatively calm  Market volatility has jumped  After months of calm in U S  stocks  the Cboe Volatility Index  a widely followed options based barometer of expected near term volatility for stocks  last week hit its highest close since January  The index jumped again on Monday  Within stocks  the hardest hit have been companies that rely heavily on global trade   Technology  the stock market s leader so far this year  was the day s worst performing sector  falling 3 7   while Apple Inc  NASDAQ AAPL    Boeing  NYSE BA  Co and  Caterpillar  Inc  NYSE CAT  were among the S P 500 s biggest drags  At the same time  the S P 500 utilities index rose 1 1  and the real estate index was flat   While the S P 500 fell 2 4  on Monday in its biggest daily percentage loss since Jan  3  U S  Treasury yields dropped to six week lows  Ten year yields fell below those on three month Treasury bills  A sustained inversion of this part of the yield curve has preceded every U S  recession in the past 50 years  In addition to more tariffs  traders are concerned China  the largest foreign U S  creditor  may dump Treasuries to counter the Trump administration s hardening trade stance   Such a move would send U S  borrowing costs soaring  strengthen the yuan and hurt Chinese exporters   How low can yields go just became the operative question   said Ian Lyngen  head of U S  rates strategy at BMO Capital Markets in New York  Many investors remain hopeful of an eventual trade agreement  and some said the recent selling in stocks is not a big concern   I don t think the market is doing anything other than taking a breather   said Jamie Cox  managing partner of Harris Financial Group in Richmond  Virginia   If there was a situation where there wasn t some type of trade deal  you would see markets much worse  and it would be across the board   But many are wondering how long investors will tolerate the uncertainty surrounding the talks  
 Investors have wanted to believe the best   said Kristina Hooper  chief global market strategist at Invesco in New York  Yet   clearly this relationship is deteriorating  It s not what investors had hoped it was on Friday  "

The Zacks Research Daily presents the best research output of our analyst team  Today s Research Daily features new research reports on 12 major stocks  including Boeing  BA   Schlumberger  SLB  and JPMorgan  NYSE JPM   JPM   These research reports have been hand picked from the roughly 70 reports published by our analyst team today 
You can see 
Boeing s shares have surged  93 7  over the past year  outperforming the Zacks Aerospace   Defense sector  which gained  43  during the same time period  Boeing is the largest aircraft manufacturer in the world in terms of revenue  orders and deliveries  and one of the largest aerospace and defense contractors  
The company s 20 year market outlook  forecasts commercial jetliner demand to increase by 3 6   The single aisle jets are expected to be the major driver behind demand growth  Further  the company s defense business stands out among its peers by virtue of its broadly diversified programs and strong order bookings  
However  the company continues to face challenges from order cancellations  stiff competition as well as falling delivery numbers  Boeing s 787 Dreamliner s deferred production cost also remains a cause of concern for the company  For its 747 model  weak demand for large commercial passenger and freighter aircraft also adds to the woes 
 You can   
Shares of Schlumberger lost  17 1  value year to date  following the Zacks Oil and Gas Field Services industry s  26 2  decline  Schlumberger is the world s largest oilfield services company  The firm s focus on lucrative international markets deserves special mention  Being the leading provider of technology for complex oilfield projects  Schlumberger is better positioned than most peers to take up new offshore projects in the shallow water basins outside North America  Also  the company s dividend yield is higher than Zacks Oil Field Services industry  
However  lack of exposure to profitable U S  shale plays might reduce the number of oilfield service contracts for Schlumberger  Moreover  since 2015  long term debt at Schlumberger has been on the rise  Also  the company s cash balance has been going down steeply since the beginning of 2016 
 You can   
JPMorgan s shares have marginally outperformed the Zacks Major Regional Banks industry over the past six months    7 9  vs   7 4    This price performance is backed by impressive earnings surprise history  
The company has surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings in all the trailing four quarters  Its efforts to control expenses through streamlining and branch consolidation are commendable  These have been supporting bottom line growth  While the company faces a persistent fee income growth challenge  the improved rate scenario  potential lesser regulations and rising loan demand should continue to benefit its financials

"By Yimou Lee HONG KONG  Reuters    After announcing its first ever drop in iPhone sales on Tuesday  Apple Inc  NASDAQ AAPL  sought to reassure investors by saying its latest and cheapest model was in strong demand after being launched in late March  Some retailers and suppliers in Asia aren t so sure  In a Reuters survey of 10 retailers in Hong Kong  Beijing  Shanghai and Shenzhen  seven   including four Apple Stores   reported solid early demand  but three third party retailers said sales were weak  Two suppliers of components for Apple phones  including the new iPhone SE  said they were seeing lower orders   I ve been dealing with iPhones for five to six years now  This current quarter for Apple feels weak   said an executive at a Taiwan based company whose components are used in iPhones including the SE model  which markets for  399   Our current shipment situation for Apple is not like the last two years  There are more iPhone models  but the total volume of iPhones is falling   Such a mixed outlook from Greater China  its most important market after the United States and generator of a quarter of the company s revenue  could be a major cause of concern for Apple   The company s revenue from the region  which includes Hong Kong and Taiwan  dropped 26 percent in the March quarter  making it the weakest region in the world  Apple did not respond to requests for comment on the Reuters survey   STILL POPULAR  iPhone is still popular but sales have dropped because    there s no new model and the SE is similar to 5C  So it doesn t sell well   said Zhu You Peng  a salesman at Apple product reseller Xiongyu in Shenzhen  The 5C was Apple s last attempt to produce a cheaper phone  back in 2013  Zhu said it sold around 300 iPhones per month last year but the number has dropped to around 100 200 this year  That view contrasts with upbeat comments about the phone from Apple s Chief Financial Officer Luca Maestri on Tuesday   The situation right now around the world is that we are supply constrained   he told Reuters  referring to the iPhone SE   The demand has been very  very strong   The iPhone SEs are sold out in Apple s own stores in mainland China and customers have to wait about three weeks to get the product delivered by Apple  according to Apple s websites  The size of the original supplies to the stores is unclear  Apple  whose shares dropped about 8 percent after it reported the disappointing first quarter results on Tuesday  is under pressure to show that the decline in iPhone sales represents just a hiccup  rather than a permanent shift for the product that fueled its meteoric rise   It isn t the only challenge facing the U S  technology giant  Its mobile entertainment services were blocked online in China earlier this month just at a time when it wants to grow services business as potential source of revenue against tapering iPhone sales  The New York Times reported that a state regulator had demanded Apple halt the services  The new phone was seen as an important offsetting influence in subsequent periods until Apple launches its iPhone 7   widely expected around September  The lower price point was part of a strategy to compete against Asian rivals in emerging markets such as China  At the iPhone SE product launch in March  Apple vice president of iPhone Product Marketing Greg Joswiak singled out China as a target market  saying four inch displays like that on the iPhone SE were still popular with first time smartphone buyers  Apple s mainstream iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus have 4 7 inch and 5 5 inch screens  SUPPLIERS ARE NOT UPBEAT  Another supplier said iPhone orders will be lower in the second quarter and second half of this year  It also provides a component for the SE model   Our customer is aiming for a higher target  but we are more conservative on that   the person said  referring to Apple  That adds to concern that Apple may further lose momentum in China  where slowing economic growth may prompt more consumers to snap up cheaper phones   Local brands are taking up more sales  especially among low income people who earn less than 3 000 yuan a month  OPPO  Vivo phones that cost around 1 000 2 000 yuan sells the best among them   said Zhu at Xiongyu  Aided by strong market share gain in China  Chinese smartphone vendors shipped more smartphones globally than Apple and Samsung Electronics  KS 005930  Co combined had supplied for the first time in the first quarter  according to research firm TrendForce  Underscoring the surging growth for Chinese vendors  Huawei Technologies Co Ltd  HWT UL   third largest after Samsung and Apple  reported earlier this month a 62 percent growth in global smartphone shipments in the first quarter   Consumers who want to show they are rich enough  they will buy an iPhone    those who want to use something different  they will choose Samsung   Joonsuh Kim  chief design officer of Huawei s consumer business group  told Reuters  referring to consumers in China

growth Communications Solutions revenues climbed 4  year over year to  658 million  Orders were up 6  year over year to  412 million  led by strength in Asia in both Data and Devices and Appliances

"By Chris Prentice  Venus Wu and Yawen Chen NEW YORK HONG KONG BEIJING  Reuters    Apple  NASDAQ AAPL  farmers across the U S  Northwest fear they will be the next victims of a U S  China trade war that left cherry growers in the same region with weak prices and having to scramble for alternative buyers because of prohibitive Chinese tariffs   U S  President Donald Trump has dealt a blow to farmers this year with strong arm trade tactics that have prompted retaliation from key markets for U S  products  including the sweet cherries and apples that speckle landscapes across the Western United States from summer through autumn    We d like this to be settled right away  but it doesn t seem like it will be  so we re just holding on   said Ray Norwood  director of sales and marketing for Auvil Fruit Co  a Washington grower of cherries and apples  The apple is the state s top agricultural crop  representing some  2 billion to  2 5 billion in sales each year  according to the Washington Apple Commission  While the bulk of these apples are consumed domestically  about 30 percent are exported and are vulnerable to tariffs  China is the world s largest producer of the fruit  but it has also become a major destination for U S  grown varieties like Red Delicious and Gala apples  according to industry experts  Cherry producers  which ship about a third of their fragile and highly perishable crop overseas  saw shipments held up at Chinese ports and ultimately slapped with prohibitive duties in the harvest  which ran through mid August  That had a notable impact on Auvil s bottom line  Norwood said   Auvil had to lower prices and find alternative destinations as China is one of the top three export markets for about 80 percent of the farm s cherry sales   One Shanghai based fruit retailer said many cherries went to Hong Kong instead of Mainland China  Prices there dropped from an average of HK 50  US 6 40  per pound to as low as HK 30 per pound in a landmark century old fruit market in Kowloon s Yau Ma Tei district    Growers of apples and other specialty crops are worried they may experience the same fate that cherry growers and shippers already faced  having to scramble for alternative buyers at lower prices because steep duties imposed by China  India and Mexico make their products too expensive for those markets  The governments of those key destinations have countered Trump s tariffs with hefty levies of their own  The same uncertainty is plaguing growers of almonds  pistachios  pears  peaches and other produce and high value crops  The direct impact of the tariffs on U S  fruit  vegetable and tree nut sales is expected to swell to more than  2 6 billion  according to a recent study conducted by University of California Davis economists  U S  Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue unveiled a  12 billion aid package last week that included  1 2 billion for the purchase of apples  pears  pistachios and other such crops  but farmers said it likely would not be enough   Dennis Nuxoll  vice president of federal affairs for the Western Growers in Washington  DC  said the group never expected U S  Department of Agriculture to make up for growers  losses but had hoped for more direct assistance   The group said in a statement that the aid program  will fall substantially short   Auvil is based in Orondo  a town nestled in Washington state  home to about 60 percent of U S  fresh apple production   Apple sellers like Auvil are bracing for the same downturn that hit cherries  just as U S  orchards ramp up harvesting of some 4 7 million tonnes    I don t know just how much it ll be down  but we do think it ll be drastic   said Rebecca Lyons  international marketing director of the Washington Apple Commission in Wenatchee  Washington  noting effective 50 percent levies on U S  apples in China  Mexico  India and China  which are expected to have duties in place during the shipping season  represent about half of total U S  export volumes of the fruit  she said  
 The global apple market is very competitive     Even if the tariffs are lifted  it ll be harder for us to get back into those markets  "

"By Nandita Bose BOULDER  Colo   Reuters    In April 2019  Tile com  which helps users find lost or misplaced items  suddenly found itself competing with Apple Inc  NASDAQ AAPL   after years of enjoying a mutually beneficial relationship with the iPhone maker  Apple carried Tile on its app store and had sold its products at its stores since 2015  It had even showcased Tile s technology at a big event in 2018  The startup had sent an engineer to Apple s headquarters to develop a feature with the company s voice assistant  Siri  Then  in early 2019  Tile s executives read news reports of Apple launching a hardware product  along with a service that resembled what Tile sold  In June  Apple stopped selling Tile s products in its stores and has since hired its engineer  The smart tracker startup was one of four companies that testified at the latest hearing of the U S  House Judiciary Committee s antitrust subcommittee in Colorado on Friday  The smaller companies are seeking to urge Congress to look at how big tech use their considerable clout to hurt rivals  Similar investigations are underway at the Justice Department  at the Federal Trade Commission  and with a bipartisan collection of attorneys general from dozens of states   After thoughtful consideration and months of bringing our concerns to Apple through regular    channels  Tile has made the decision to continue raising concerns over Apple s anti competitive practices   Tile s general counsel Kirsten Daru told Reuters in an interview ahead of the hearing  An Apple spokesman said the company has not built a business model around knowing a customer s location or the location of their device  In September  House lawmakers asked more than 80 companies for information about how their businesses may have been harmed by anti competitive behavior from Apple  Amazon  NASDAQ AMZN   Facebook  NASDAQ FB   and Alphabet s Google  NASDAQ GOOGL   In October  Committee Chairman David Cicilline said he expected to have a final report on its probe by the  first part  of 2019  On Friday  Cicilline delivered a scathing statement against big tech   Companies    both large and small  have found themselves dependent on the arbitrary whim of these platform giants  one algorithm tweak away from ruin   Cicilline said   Because their decisions are largely unaccountable  opaque  and result in sweeping consequences  the dominant platforms effectively serve as private regulators   he said  PopSockets  a seller of collapsible phone grips  testified against Amazon  The company s chief executive David Barnett said the firm started as a seller on Amazon s third party marketplace and then sold items directly to Amazon as a vendor  but decided to end its relationship with the company after two years in 2018   Barnett said Amazon required PopSockets to pay almost  2 million in marketing so it could market its products as originals in the face of a wave of counterfeits  The online retailer  frequently lowered their selling price of our product and then expected and needed us to help pay for the lost margin   he said   On multiple occasions we found that Amazon Retail was itself sourcing counterfeit PopGrips and selling them alongside our authentic products   he told lawmakers  Amazon spokesman Jack Evans said PopSockets was free to choose which retailers it supplies and could choose to stop selling via Amazon  Third party sellers continue to sell the product on the platform   We ve continued to work with PopSockets to address our shared concerns about counterfeit   Evans said  Basecamp  which sells an online project management tool  complained about Google allowing competitors to bid to have their own ads run when its trademarked name was typed into the search engine  It said the practice allowed competitors to purchase ads that made it hard for consumers to reach Basecamp s website  co founder David Heinemeier Hansson told Reuters in an interview ahead of the hearing  The company has opened multiple trademark infringement investigations with Google but the process is  onerous and slow   he said   Google s monopoly on internet search must be broken up for the sake of a fair marketplace   Hansson said  Basecamp is now forced to run a more than  70 000 annual advertising campaign to counteract the effect  he said  Google spokesman Jose Castaneda said for trademarked terms like names of a business  the company s policy balances the interest of both users and advertisers  
Google allows competitors to bid on trademarked terms because that offers users more choice when they are searching  but if a trademark owner files a complaint  Google blocks competitors from using their actual name in the text of the advertisement  Castaneda said "

Daily FX Market Roundup October 30  2019
The Federal Reserve lowered interest rates for the third time this year by 25bp  While the move was widely expected  it triggered a small expansion in FX volatility  USD JPY surged above 109 to a high of 109 28 before u turning lower while EUR USD dropped to 1 1080 and then rebounded above 1 1140  Fed Chairman Powell made it clear that Wednesday s move was an insurance cut aimed at offsetting the risk of softer global growth and uncertain trade developments  Despite the decision to ease  the FOMC statement and Powell s comments were laced with optimism  The Fed expects the economy to continue to grow at a moderate rate as they see a strong labor market and consumption  Their worries center on investment and exports but with Brexit and trade risks easing  they  believe monetary policy is in a good place   All of this tells us that the Fed is done for the year and has no intention of lowering rates further  In fact Powell said point blank   we re not thinking about raising rates right now   Yet the dollar failed to hold onto its gains as Wednesday s move turned out more positive for risk than for the greenback  This could be tied to Powell s warning that the General Motors  NYSE GM  strike could cut growth by a couple tenths this quarter or to worries about Apple  NASDAQ AAPL  earnings  Investors may also be refraining from major positions ahead of Friday s nonfarm payrolls report  Regardless of the motivation  we don t expect further cuts from the Fed this year so the dollar should start to trend higher 
Meanwhile  the Bank of Canada set a bottom in USD CAD with their monetary policy statement  The BoC s decision to leave interest rates unchanged was widely anticipated but instead of emphasizing the strength of the labor market and the positive outlook for the economy  the central bank said the  resilience of Canada s economy  will be increasingly tested   They saw the outlook weakening since July with trade conflicts likely to cause business investments and exports to shrink in the second half of the year  Canada is not immune to global developments and could slow below potential in H2  Although they raised their 2019 GDP forecast  they cut their Q3 forecast and lowered their growth projections for 2020 and 2021  According to Governor Poloz  the central bank considered whether the downside risks warranted stimulus  which at this point  they do not  While these cautionary comments drove USD CAD straight to resistance at the 20 day SMA near 1 3180  we expect further weakness in the loonie  particularly against the euro  U S  and Australian dollars  Today s move should mark the beginning of broader profit taking on long Canadian dollar trades 
The Australian and New Zealand dollars traded higher on the back of risk appetite  Data from Australia was also good with price pressures rising slightly in the third quarter  On a quarterly basis  CPI rose 0 5   which was in line with expectations and this helped to boost year over year growth  to 1 7  from 1 6   On Monday night  Reserve Bank of Australia Governor Lowe said they are prepared to ease policy further if needed but rate cuts are having a  positive effect  on the economy and we believe that the chance of another move this year is slim  The focus shifts to the New Zealand dollar  which has been an underdog tonight  Building permits and business confidence numbers are scheduled for release  NZD data has been mostly soft and if this trend continues  we could see AUD NZD hit fresh year to date highs 
Both currencies remain in play tonight with Chinese PMIs scheduled for release  Chile also canceled their APEC summit next month amid unrest and protests  According to President Trump  the time frame for finalizing the deal remains the same  China suggested that President Xi meet with President Trump in Macau and we are still waiting to see if the U S  agrees  At the same time  the deal is still being negotiated and is in the process of being written and could fall apart at any time  According to Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin  it will take time for China to  scale up  to the  40 billion to  50 billion in annual agricultural purchases promised by Trump "
Campbell Soup Company   NYSE CPB   posted third quarter fiscal 2018 results  wherein earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate and improved year over year  However  sales came almost in line with the estimates Further  shares of the company lost 10 8  in the pre market trading as management trimmed its earnings guidance for fiscal 2018  In the last three months  this Zacks Rank  3  Hold  stock has declined 24 2   wider than the  s fall of 9 2   Q3 HighlightsAdjusted earnings of 70 cents per share increased 18 6  year over year and outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 60 cents  Including one time items  Campbell incurred loss per share of  1 31 per share compared to earnings of 58 cents in the year ago quarter Net sales of  2 125 million grew 14 7  and came almost in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  2 128 million  The year over year improvement was owing to gains from buyouts of Snyder s Lance and Pacific Foods as well as currency tailwinds  Further  organic sales remained flat with year ago quarter as declines in the Americas Simple Meals and Beverages division was compensated with gains from the Global Biscuits and Snacks  and Campbell Fresh segments Furthermore  the company s adjusted gross margin contracted 3 9 percentage points to 32   The decline was mainly due to cost inflation  escalated supply chain expenses and promotional spending as well as the dilutive effect from recent buyouts  This was somewhat negated by productivity improvements as well as gains from cost savings Moreover  adjusted EBIT in the quarter was up 1  to  308 million  However  excluding the impact from the recent buyouts  adjusted EBIT fell mainly due to lower gross margin  partly offset by reduced adjusted administrative expenses and  adjusted marketing and selling costs  Campbell Soup Company Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise     Segment AnalysisThe Latin America business is managed as part of the Global Biscuits and Snacks segment starting from fiscal 2018  Earlier  this division formed part of the Americas Simple Meals and Beverages segment Campbell reports its results under three segments namely  Americas Simple Meals and Beverages  Global Biscuits and Snacks  and Campbell Fresh Americas Simple Meals and Beverages  In third quarter fiscal 2018  sales at the division rose 5  year over year to  1 010 million backed by gains from Pacific Foods buyout  However  the segment s organic sales were down 2  mainly due to softness across Plum products  V8 Beverages and U S  soup  Excluding gains from the Pacific Foods buyout  sales at U S  soup dipped 1  on account of a drop in condensed soups  somewhat offset by broth and ready to serve soups sales Global Biscuits and Snacks  Sales at this division surged 35  at  862 million  Excluding gains from the Snyder s Lance s buyout and currency translations  organic sales grew 1  owing to strength in Pepperidge Farm snacks  representing growth in Goldfish crackers and Pepperidge Farm cookies Campbell Fresh  Sales at this segment rose 1  to  251 million  mainly by gains from refrigerated soup  However  sales of Bolthouse Farms refrigerated beverages remained flat with the year ago period FinancialsCampbell ended the quarter with cash and cash equivalents of  199 million  total debt of  9 843 million and total equity of  1 411 million  Additionally  the company generated  1 024 million as cash flow from operations in the first nine months of fiscal 2018 Fiscal 2018 OutlookCampbell has completed the buyout of Snyder s Lance  Inc  in the reported quarter  This acquisition is likely to aid the company in fortifying its snacking brands  portfolio  thus making it a snacking leader  However  it has been witnessing challenges related to the execution along with some external headwinds  Nevertheless  management has been considering its strategic plans and portfolio composition  which should enhance the company s operating performance and boost shareholder value Following the quarterly results  management trimmed its earnings forecast for fiscal 2018  while updated sales and adjusted EBIT views to include the effects from Snyder s Lance s buyout  The company now projects sales growth to range from positive 10 11  compared with negative 1  to positive 1  guided earlier  Further  adjusted EBIT is expected to decline in the band of 6 8  compared with prior guidance of decrease in the range of 5 7  Adjusted earnings are now envisioned in the band of  2 85  2 90 per share  reflecting decline of 5 6  from fiscal 2017  The Zacks Consensus Estimate is currently pegged at  3 12  which is likely to witness a downward revision  Earlier  management projected earnings per share in the  3 10  3 17 band  which reflected growth of 2 4  from last year

"T2108 Status  56 7  VIX Status  13 1 General  Short term  Trading Call  Aggressive traders should stay short  Stop out on S P 500 follow through above 1800  Also see below for notes on Black Friday  Active T2108 periods  Day  100 over 20   overperiod   Day  8 under 60   underperiod   Day  13 under 70  Commentary The S P 500 stopped short of triggering the condition that ends my latest attempt to play the T2108 trade from the bearish side as explained in the last T2108 Update  The index hit an all time intraday high of 1802 before pulling back for a fractional close on the day  Shorts should end with the S P 500 closing above 1800 for two days in a row   The first close is the warning  The second close higher is the confirmation  The loss on the day was very mild  but the VIX soared 7 5   I strongly suspect this was a result of the large number of speculative  high flying  and similar kinds of momentum stocks that got slammed on the day  especially in technology and even more so in internet cloud social networking stocks  I was surprised that this selling did not ding the indices more but the NASDAQ did manage to lose 0 9   I was tempted to add a second tranche of SSO puts based on this weakness but decided against it  I will only add  or start fresh  once if T2108 flips to overbought again In the meantime  the indices technically have more room to grow on the upside with T2108 still below 60   HOWEVER  the S P 500 is now up a surprising 2 5  even after T2108 has traded 8 days under 60   The chart below shows that this performance is toward the high end of the range that we should expect once if T2108 cross above 60  again  There are some very dramatic examples of the selling that happened Monday  While the general market seems content to ignore it  I do not think we should  especially some of these stocks hit important technical levels  I mention these in the labels on the charts  Facebook  FB  fell 6 5   Zillow  Z  fell 4 9   Tesla  TSLA  fell 10 2   Apple  AAPL  was the lightweight with a 1 2  but it is forming an ominous Bollinger Band squeeze These charts are just hints of what looks like natural profit taking after an incredible year in so many momentum stocks  I was thinking sellers would wait until January in order to push out the tax consequences  Perhaps they agree that the technical signs suggest that now is the time to get out while the getting is good  One special note on Tesla  TSLA   While I fully recognize the current short term downtrend  I have also been dying to get in at cheaper prices  I took advantage of the deep 10  plunge to sell my puts and turn around and buy shares and a few speculative calls  As momentum potentially shifts from buyers to sellers in tech stocks and other speculative names  Black Friday looms right over the horizon  I studied the importance of this season last year in a piece titled  Quantifying the Significance of Black Friday Trading   This piece came on the heels of the 6th best Black Friday performance on the S P 500 since 1950  My analysis found several important things 

A tendency for the S P 500 to trade up on Black Friday 
2012 s large Black Friday gains broke the longest losing streak of Black Fridays since 1950  3 years in a row of down Black Fridays 
A slight tendency for the Monday following Black Friday to close down 
IF the S P 500 manages to close higher on the following Monday  then odds are very high that the index will not look back for weeks and maybe months 
Special recognition goes to 1951  1988  1991  2011  and NOW 2012 as years featuring Black Fridays where the S P 500 never closed below the close of Black Friday 

So if Black Friday can be such a bright beacon for bulls  why do I call this 2013 s last stand for bears  Basically  if bears fail to push the S P 500 below Black Friday s close  whether it is an up or down day  in the following week  they can pretty much kiss 2013 goodbye  and 2014 could be rough as well  As always  I will take this one step at a time  For now  I am monitoring closely the momo stocks for further profit taking and preparing for some Black Friday shopping in the stock market By the way  December tends to be a very mild month as far as drawdowns go  Since 1950 the median of all maximum losses in December is  1 0   This is the best of ALL months  closely followed by March and November each at  1 1   The average maximum loss for the month of December is  1 6   Again  the best showing of any month of the year  More details to come in a future post  I spent too much time trying to recover as much of a week of work as I could thanks to a server failure at my hosting company  Lightning has struck my blog TWICE this year now  Black line  T2108  measured on the right   Green line  S P 500  for comparative purposes Red line  T2108 Overbought  70    Blue line  T2108 Oversold  20  Be careful out there Full disclosure  Long SSO puts  long TSLA shares and calls  short FB  long FB calls  short Z  long Z calls  long AAPL shares  long AAPL puts  calls  and put spread "

"The S P kept rising on Tuesday and touched another record high  but couldn t hold onto the gain through the close as the market awaits tomorrow s Fed announcement 
	The index snapped a four session winning streak today  but only slipped by 0 08  to 3036 89 
	Just yesterday  a new record was reached for the first time since late July  And the S P remains just a few points away from making history all over again after holding onto most of its recent advances 
	The new intraday high is just below 3048 
	The Dow followed the same trajectory and ended with a slide of only 0 07   or around 19 points  to 27 071 46 after flirting with a positive close 
	The NASDAQ  though  took much more of a beating than its counterparts on Tuesday  The index never saw the plus side in the session and snapped its own 4 day winning streak with a drop of 0 59   or around 49 points  to 8276 85 
	It was a rough day for tech as Alphabet  NASDAQ GOOGL  slipped more than 2  after missing earnings in its quarterly report from yesterday  Also  Apple  NASDAQ AAPL  dipped about 2 3  on the eve of its own report coming after the bell tomorrow 
	The market was most likely a bit nervous about Wednesday s Fed statement  even though its widely expected that we ll get another rate cut  the third of the year  Nevertheless  the Committee always carries the possibility of surprise  either in their actions or their language 
	Assuming there are no shocks from Powell   Friends  the market will be paying close attention to the iPhone maker s report to see if this better than feared earnings season continues

It s being half a decade since IoT has made its presence felt and now its popularity has spread to different spheres  Investors witnessing the story of five long glorious years of IoT stocks currently look confident enough before vouching for any There are a large number of IoT companies  which are making the world look smarter  smaller and well connected  However  the best part is that its benefits are not limited to the technology space alone  We see a number of other industries benefiting from it including the medical device space If you are not conviced yet  investors are almost dumbfounded by the colossal 259 3  surge  since 2014  in medical device Internet of Things stock  Dexcom   NASDAQ DXCM    This smart glucose monitoring device maker has had a huge impact on the investment world  It is time for us to wake up to the latest revolution in technology   the Internet of Medical Things  IoMT  or Medical Internet of Things  MIoT    What s IoMT Consider a situation when you get a report on your body s hydration level just by clicking on the smart water bottle app on your mobile phone  Another smart IoMT device emerging fast is Wireless Vital Sign Monitoring system  providing wireless continuous beat by beat blood pressure reading  The same app also measures heart rate  blood oxygen level and other physiological parameters  Smart stethoscope  smart injection device  smart thermostats or advanced hearing aids are a few other IoMT devices through which the medical device industry is fast shifting from reactive patient care to a proactive one Another important new age IoMT device is the smart pill  These oral medications with ingestible sensors for gastrointestinal healthcare are commonly used in patients with dementia or any other mental illness  In this regard  Medtronic s   NYSE MDT   SmartPill motility testing system deserves a mention IoMT is not limited to a single device  Going by an article of   IBM s Watson Health has teamed up with Thomas Jefferson University in Philadelphia to create a smart hospital room for the three hospitals the university oversees  This concept has come into focus on growing demand for remote patient monitoring and chronic disease management 5G to be a Game ChangerAs Jamie Carter says   Never mind the  things   it s the data they create which is vital  The entire concept of IoMT is based on Internet connected devices  Undoubtedly  the rise of cloud platforms  phones  phablets  tablets and other smart devices as well as apps has made acceptance of IoMT easier among the masses  In fact  big medical and non MedTech players are all waiting for the next wave of mobile technology  5G  which is expected to take IoMT to an all new level  Per a  report  the  5G capability will allow for much more efficient and prompt device to device communication  thus making the medical Internet of things an operational reality  Industry Trend and ProspectsGoing by a recent article by   the global IoMT market is expected to register CAGR of 38 67  in the 2019 2026 period  projects that by 2020  40  of IoT related technology will be health related  ahead of any other category  Not only that  by this period  IoMT will take up around  117 billion market share Non MedTech Players Also Grabbing the OpportunityNeedless to say  this enormous prospect is luring even non MedTech players  Late last year  Apple   NASDAQ AAPL   gained FDA approval for Apple Watch 4 that has ECG app and provides irregular heart rhythm notification  Samsung  KS 005930  s S Patch ECG provides easier ECG monitoring  These are all strong indications that investors should start to focus on IoMT centric investment 2 MedTech Stocks to Watch Out ForBelow we have highlighted two stocks from the medical devices space  other than Dexcom  that are quite capable of  leveraging IoMT market opportunities Medtronic A few years back  this medical device major entered into a global  multi year collaboration with Qualcomm

According to a study by independent research firm Rhodium Group  Chinese foreign direct investments  FDI  in the United States has steadily witnessed a downtrend  primarily due to mutual distrust and souring geopolitical relationship  As both the countries hold high level negotiations to seek a long term solution to the bitter trade war  experts widely believe that the situation is not likely to improve in the near future until some sweeping policy changes are made The research report revealed that China s U S  FDI declined 84  year over year to  4 8 billion in 2018   the lowest since 2011  Incidentally  the tally reached a record high of  46 billion in 2016  before decreasing to  29 billion in 2017  Excluding divestures of about  13 billion worth of U S  assets  China s net FDI in 2018 was a negative  8 billion  However  venture capital financing by the communist nation hit an all time high of  3 1 billion last year as investors were subjected to comparatively less regulatory hurdles The report attributes this decline to closed loop Chinese policies and strict scrutiny by the Trump administration on grounds of national security interests  Over the past year  Beijing s restrictive policies have reportedly forced its conglomerates to consolidate domestic operations and reduce debt by selling their foreign investments  With a fragile Balance of Payments situation  the strategic move was largely aimed to restrict its outbound capital control On the other hand  growing resentments about high Balance of Trade with China and Trump s  America First  policy led to intense scrutiny by the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States to validate Chinese acquisitions  This eventually led to rejection of a high percentage of Chinese transactions on security issues  To add to the woes  trade barriers and a series of retaliatory measures compounded problems  creating uncertainty in the markets and dampening investor appetite Although the underlying issue is cited to be related to national security concerns  the bone of contention perhaps stems from an innate desire between the two warring nations to claim dominance in cutting edge technologies and the next generation of wireless services Relations between the United States and China were further strained when Meng Wanzhou  the chief financial officer of Huawei  was arrested in Canada over potential violations of sanctions on Iran  Serving as the deputy chairwoman of the management board  Meng is the daughter of the founder of Huawei  Consequently  the detention and eventual arrest of such a high profile business tycoon rattled the markets and put the political environment on high alert Although Meng has been granted bail  the matter remained a potboiler as she faced probable extradition to the United States  The Sino American tensions elicited strong protests from China against the perceived undemocratic act and threatened to derail the 90 day truce offer to initiate negotiations related to the tariff war  However  officials from both countries have reportedly initiated trade talks to ease the tariff restrictions imposed on each other Despite the thaw  industry experts opine that the underlying factors will continue to weigh on the mutual relationship  as both governments face intense pressure from within to maintain their hard stance with national pride at stake  Moreover  China is unlikely to ease restrictions on outbound investments as higher interest rates in the United States could further aggravate pressure on its Balance of Payments  In addition  implementation of the Foreign Investment Risk Review Modernization Act in the United States further aims to enforce a stricter probe of national security screenings of Chinese FDI and venture capital transactions in critical emerging technologies and critical infrastructure Consequently  U S  companies that derive substantial revenues from China are likely to be affected in the future  These mostly include technology companies like QUALCOMM Incorporated   NASDAQ QCOM    which generated  14 6 billion sales from China in fiscal 2018  65 4  of total revenues   Qorvo  Inc    NASDAQ QRVO     1 9 billion  62    and Broadcom Inc    NASDAQ AVGO     9 5 billion  53 7   It remains to be seen how 2019 pans out for these stocks and whether they can beat the odds to record healthy top line growth in China More Stock News  This Is Bigger than the iPhone It could become the mother of all technological revolutions  Apple  NASDAQ AAPL  sold a mere 1 billion iPhones in 10 years but a new breakthrough is expected to generate more than 27 billion devices in just 3 years  creating a  1 7 trillion market Zacks has just released a Special Report that spotlights this fast emerging phenomenon and 6 tickers for taking advantage of it  If you don t buy now  you may kick yourself in 2020

"U S  equities have had a stellar run on robust growth and rising optimism around President Donald Trump s tax reform 
Senate Passes GOP Tax Bill
The Senate passed the GOP  just after midnight in Washington on Wednesday  The bill passed 51 to 48 and will be sent to the House for a final vote before it can be signed by Trump  The final vote in the House is required as three provisions were stripped from the bill  owing to Senate rules  However  this vote is considered a formality 
The corporate tax rate will be cut to 21  from the current 35   Moreover  repatriating foreign earnings is expected to get cheaper  as the proposed version would tax companies  overseas income held as cash at 15 5   while non cash holdings will be taxed at 8    
Individual income taxes will be cut but will expire in 2025  unlike corporate taxes  Although seven tax brackets are maintained  various analyses predict that few middleclass earners might have a higher tax bill 
Tax Bill Implications
Per a Financial Times article citing a  analysis  it has been estimated that average earnings per share will be increased by 6 3  in 2018 owing to tax reform savings 
However  in the long run  major concerns remain around the deficit the tax bill will add  The Treasury department suggested that GDP will grow at 2 9  in the next decade and will raise  1 8 trillion in the period  which will provide an additional  300 billion over and above the tax revenue deficit  However  this is in stark contrast to other analyses that suggest a more conservative growth estimate and an addition to the deficit ranging from  448 billion to more than  1 trillion over the next decade 
As of now  analysts predict that the markets have not yet fully priced in the tax reform  Let us now discuss a few leveraged ETFs focused on providing exposure to the large cap U S  equity space

"By Huw Jones LONDON  Reuters    New European rules on online payments and banking due to go into effect on Saturday mark the start of a  slow burn  revolution that will prise open traditional retail banking and may force lenders to rethink their business models  regulators say  The Payments Services Directive 2  PSD2   which allows retailers and consumers to bypass banks by authorizing payments directly from personal accounts  among other things  aims to cut costs and increase choice by widening the range of firms offering financial services  The European Union rules  which also reflect rapid advances in technology in banking like the use of smart phones  open the door to  fintech  online applications like Money Dashboard  Plum and Moneybox  as well as established retail giants like Amazon  NASDAQ AMZN   Apple  NASDAQ AAPL   Facebook  NASDAQ FB  and Google  NASDAQ GOOGL    The development of the market is likely to be a slow burn   said Karina McTeague  director of retail banking supervision at Britain s regulator  the Financial Conduct Authority  FCA    We  like everyone in this industry  don t know exactly which direction it will go   Industry experts said the directive would likely have enormous implications for traditional retail banks  Although firms with PSD2 licenses will not be authorized to take deposits or make loans  bypassing the banks means debit or credit cards will not be necessary for most of their customers  online transactions  Customers will also be able to authorize firms to access their accounts to help them manage their finances  for example by guiding them to the cheapest points of credit and consolidating data from accounts with more than one bank  which banks have resisted up until now    PSD2 is a revolutionary piece of regulation that is likely to signal the end of the high street bank in the medium to long term   said Michael McKee  head of financial services regulation at international law firm DLA Piper   The FCA said it has received 40 license applications for PSD2 services in Britain  As many as a dozen could be in place by Saturday  it said  The directive puts the EU at the forefront of efforts to disrupt the central role of banks in how people pay for goods and services online and encourage competition by giving customers the right to share their account data   Fintech startups in the United States have argued that a little known provision in the Dodd Frank Act gives them the right to source data from their customers  accounts  but say some banks have been slow to comply   OPEN BANKING The  open banking  system may take a while to gain momentum with the public  British government efforts to make it easier to switch bank accounts have had limited success due to customer inertia  for example  Another difficulty is convincing customers that their bank account data is safe in the hands of outside firms   It will be a challenge for all existing banks and payments firms  given their responsibilities to protect information  to properly and promptly handle requests for access to customer data from new open banking portals   said Tim Dolan  a regulation lawyer at Reed Smith  Steve Tigar  CEO of Edinburgh based personal financial management service Money Dashboard  said the new rules will help their business by establishing trust   Using a service like Money Dashboard will become commonplace as opposed to the sole domain of early adopters   he told Reuters  The Bank of England has said direct payment and account services firms could become the future  face  of day to day banking  effectively turning traditional retail banks into vaults  That represents a challenge for banks  A BoE stress test of top UK lenders last year said PSD2 s feature of finding the cheapest credit could mean banks will lose revenue from charging for overdrafts  for example  Income from processing payments and overdrafts currently contribute 800 million pounds and 2 6 billion pounds respectively to annual pre tax profits of the major UK banks  the BoE said  That s a relatively small amount compared to the 2016 pre tax profit of 3 2 billion pounds at just one bank   Barclays   LON BARC   But banks may also have to spend more on marketing to attract and retain customers in face of increased competition  the BoE says   I think the days of when you have a big bank and it provides all the touch points to that financial services organization and provides you with all the product sets  and keeps you captive  are gone   said Anne Boden  CEO of upstart Starling Bank   PSD2 could change banking forever   Reed Smith s Dolan said there is nothing to stop banks competing in the same space  HSBC has already said it will launch a new app to aggregate bank accounts    We are expecting a mixed market to develop here with both small firms challenging and larger players offering these services to their customers for the first time   said Christopher Woolard  the FCA s executive director of strategy and competition  The FCA this year is reviewing the business models of retail banks to see if they are sustainable  and will include the impact of PSD2 as an added consideration  
Britain s plan to leave the EU next March will not affect the implementation of PSD2 because all of the EU s financial rules will be incorporated into UK law "

"Shares of Coach  Inc    NYSE COH   have fallen over 15  in a month and also underperformed the  s decline of 1 8   This fact alone is enough to unnerve investors but the question is what is bothering this Zacks Rank  3  Hold  stock  which otherwise looks quite disciplined in its approach to the changing retail landscape  Further   of A and long term earnings per share growth rate of 11 1   clearly indicate the stock s inherent potential 
Why Is the Stock Struggling 
We noticed that shares of Coach came under pressure after the company reported fourth quarter fiscal 2017 results on Aug 15  Analysts pointed that investors were not impressed by the disappointing top line performance and not so encouraging outlook in spite of integration of Kate Spade   Company 
After declining 4  during the third quarter of fiscal 2017  net sales tumbled 1 8  in the final quarter  Moreover  we also noted that the total sales of  1 133 8 million fell short of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  1 146 million for the fourth successive quarter  Sales growth were hurt by 60 basis points due to management s efforts to elevate the Coach brand s positioning in the North American wholesale channel by lowering promotional events and door closures  The company now envisions fiscal 2018 earnings in the range of  2 35  2 40 per share 
Sluggish mall traffic  increased online competition and aggressive pricing strategy are headwinds with which the industry is grappling  We note that the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  2 36 and  2 65 for fiscal 2018 and 2019 has declined by 5 cents and 6 cents  respectively  in the past 30 days  Moreover  the same has plunged 14 cents to 36 cents for the first quarter of fiscal 2018 

What Are the Tailwinds 
As one of the leading American marketers of fine accessories and gifts  Coach boasts a proven strategy of investing in stores to enhance sales output through product innovation  compelling pricing strategy  new merchandise assortments and cost effective global sourcing model  We believe that these strategies will help drive comparable store sales and operating margins in the long term  The company s growth drivers include expansion of global distribution model and venturing into under penetrated markets 
Coach is undergoing a brand transformation and introducing modern luxury concept stores in key markets  The acquisition of Stuart Weitzman has been accretive to performance and is being viewed as a significant step in its efforts toward becoming a multi brand company  The recent agreement to acquire to Kate Spade   Company for  2 4 billion is another step taken in that direction  Additionally  it is aggressively expanding e Commerce platform 
Strategic endeavors along with transformational initiatives are expected to facilitate the company to attain operating income growth of 22 25  backed by mid single digit organic growth  Kate Spade buyout and estimated synergies of  30  35 million

"By Saqib Iqbal Ahmed  NEW YORK  Reuters    The newest way to bet on the fortunes of Chinese e commerce heavyweight Alibaba Group Holding Ltd  N BABA  will debut on Monday when its stock options go live for trading  and investors should look for the initial action to be very busy  but also choppy and potentially pricey   Options market traders say Alibaba puts and calls will likely see heavy demand given the interest shown so far in the stock since its record setting  25 billion initial public offering last week   First day volume in the stock last Friday topped 270 million shares and has averaged around 40 million shares a day since  keeping it near the top of the New York Stock Exchange s most active list each day    I would expect Alibaba s options to have a built in demand  so to speak  as obviously all the people who want to get into the IPO at the beginning didn t   said J J  Kinahan  chief market strategist at retail brokerage TD Ameritrade Holding Corp   U S  options exchanges  including the Chicago Board Options Exchange  the C2 Options Exchange  ISE and ISE Gemini  are expected to list contracts on Alibaba on Sept  29  Their debut will open the gates to a flood of speculators and hedgers to begin opening positions premised on where they think the stock will trade at various future dates   Contract volume is expected to be among the more active of any name once the options are listed  said WhatsTrading com options strategist Fred Ruffy   Still  it probably will not see quite the frenzy of interest shown in Facebook Inc  O FB  options when they hit the market after the company s botched IPO in May 2012   Brian Overby  senior options analyst at online brokerage TradeKing in Charlotte  North Carolina  sees Alibaba s first day options volumes at about a quarter of Facebook s  The social media company s options volume set a record for a first day of trading with 365 000 contracts changing hands  Puts outnumbered calls by a ratio of 1 25 1 in its options debut on May 29  2012   Puts convey the right to sell the stock at a set price at a future date  while calls provide the right to buy it at a certain price at a date down the road   VOLATILITY IS THE KEY  Trading Alibaba options will be tricky at the beginning  Overby said   Option prices  called premiums  trade at a fraction of the underlying stock s price  But given the stock is still trading around  90 and daily price swings are wide  Alibaba s options are not likely to be super cheap   Moreover  making the initial determinations for what those levels should be across potentially dozens of strike prices and contract expiration dates could be dicey    At the start there will most likely be wide bid ask spreads on the option contracts until the market makers have some price discovery   Overby said   Implied volatility  a measure of the risk that big moves in the stock pose and a key component in setting options prices  is typically high for companies immediately after their IPO    Amazon com Inc  O AMZN  trades with an implied volatility of 27 percent  I would expect Alibaba to trade above that level for some time   said Ophir Gottlieb  chief executive officer at Los Angeles based Capital Market Laboratories LLC   Looking at other stocks in Alibaba s price range offers some clues about just how widely its options prices may vary   For instance  at the money options expiring in December on Apple Inc  O AAPL   currently around  98 and with a 90 day implied volatility of around 23 percent  last traded at  5 16 for calls and  4 65 for puts   But the December at the money options for TripAdvisor Inc  O TRIP   trading around  91 50 with an implied volatility nearing 40 percent  last crossed at  10 60 for calls and  6 30 for puts   NEW PLATFORM FOR SHORTS  The start of options trading also will give short sellers an additional venue for betting on a drop in the stock  Alibaba s share price has now retreated around 5 percent after a first day gain of about 38 percent   If the shares are difficult to borrow to sell short given it is still so soon after the IPO  that could drive more shorts into Alibaba options as an alternative and this could put downward pressure on the stock  said Henry Schwartz  president at options analytics firm Trade Alert   The cost to borrow Alibaba shares has varied widely in the days since the IPO   On Thursday  for instance  annual borrowing costs started the day in the 25 percent region  but plunged soon afterward  now registering just 0 2 percent  according to Karl Loomes  market analyst at SunGard s Astec Analytics  That is about the same as to borrow IBM  N IBM  or Ford Motor Co  N F  shares   The cost to borrow the average stock for shorting typically is negligible unless the stock is listed as hard to borrow    Though this is fairly low for the first days of securities lending following such a highly publicized IPO  it is probably mostly on the back of such high availability of stock to borrow rather than signifying a lack of demand   Loomes said   
Some 368 million shares were sold in the IPO  following the exercise of over allotment options by the deal s underwriters     Editing by Dan Burns and Matthew Lewis "

"Dialog Semiconductor  a chipmaker that s currently supplying Apple  NASDAQ AAPL   saw its stocks plunge recently as investors gained reason to worry about the company s long term future  Dialog Semiconductor  DE DLGS  shareholders are concerned that Apple might drop the company as one of its suppliers ahead of forthcoming product releases  meaning the company s leadership needs to act fact before the current stock spiral gets much worse 
Worries over Apple
After reports  that Apple might begin internally designing and producing the vital power chips needed to make many of its forthcoming products work  investors began eyeing Dialog with serious suspicion  Such a move by Apple could prove disastrous to Dialog s future  the company has a serious stake with the tech behemoth  and will rely on its continued success for much of its future expansion 
Dialog  which is headquartered in the UK  even conceded that Apple has the capacity  or at the very least will soon  to develop its own chips in house  Such an admission has investors scrambling  with Dialog s shares plummeting by nearly 35  since late November  Dialog highlighted the fact that it will continue to supply the lucrative power chips to Apple in 2018  however  and executives are pivoting to present a bold new strategy to the investors they hope to woo  Such work by Dialog s leadership could be done in vain  however  previous companies that lost lucrative partnerships with Apple have  over the past few years  including other UK chipmakers like Imagination Technologies  Investors will have such examples at the forefront of their minds when they decide whether they re sticking with Dialog through this slump 
While it s unlikely that Apple will pivot to full internal production immediately  the company could supply up to half of its own power management chips used in iPhones  thus alleviating concerns that it s too dependent on outside suppliers and cutting back on cost 
A shakeup is desperately needed
For Dialog Semiconductor to survive well into the 21st century  it needs a sudden  desperately  The company s lifeline in the form of its contract with Apple is likely to go away soon  if not immediately  and it needs a new long term strategy if it intends to bring any new investors on board  As it stands  shareholders are concerned that the company lacks any post Apple vision  and having seen the fates of other tech suppliers to Apple  wise investors have gotten cold feet when it comes to backing Dialog 
The company certainly isn t toast  better innovations on the part of Dialog could result in new technologies that make smartphones more effective at saving battery  for instance  Dialog is still a competent company with savvy individuals who can churn out new products in an extraordinarily lucrative market  The only question is how it can survive should Apple be producing most or all of its own power chips by 2020  and where else it might look for a lucrative partnership  Dialog  a record  363 million in 2017 third quarter revenue  an impressive figure likely to prevent too many shareholders from instantly jumping ship  Long term investors will be wondering how it can convert its growing revenue figures into a sustainable business model  however  and the company will need to show how it s allocating its profits to deal with future projects that look beyond its Apple partnership 
Other contracts signed with Apple s competitors seems unlikely  and Dialog will likely need to look at more in house innovation if it intends to remain relevant for long  The company s work on battery life in particular is promising  and its human capital could yet churn out a new service capable of keeping Apple s recurring business  but Dialog will have to jump into overdrive if it wants to avoid a total collapse  Rather that suffering the fate of company s like Imagination Technologies  Dialog needs to get started now on its work to prove to investors that it s more than a mere Apple crony  More likely than not  the company can expect consistent business with Apple until the end of 2018  meaning it should use the time until then to plot out its next strategy and clearly lay out to investors how it intends to survive  Dialog isn t in the grave yet  but the company certainly has one foot halfway in  whether or not Dialog survives is really a matter of how well it can innovate "
Faster Internet speeds and devices like smartphones and tablets have changed the face of not only communication but also that of the broadcast and TV industry  Even the radio market has evolved substantially to keep up with the changing trends Traditional cable and radio providers are gradually being replaced by over the top content providers  Streaming video and audio  including music  services are becoming popular among the younger generation who seek instant access and instant gratification While we expect that the streaming companies are here to stay  yes  even with Gen Z   investing in them might be a bit tricky   Competition is rife as everyone wants a bigger share of the pie  Moreover  in the past few years  there have been a lot of new entrants in the market like Apple   NASDAQ AAPL    Amazon   NASDAQ AMZN   and Pandora   NYSE P   among others Global political and economic changes also have a profound impact on these companies  Dishing out content that is in tune with the latest happenings contributes significantly to viewership  Recently  the Brexit mandate   the exit of Britain from the EU   has rattled the global economy   On the other hand  the U S  is gearing up for its presidential elections  which again will lead to a lot of changes   But it s important to keep in mind that even in these difficult times  there are some stocks that defy the conventional bears One such stock is video streaming giant Netflix   NASDAQ NFLX    which recorded a gain of over 129  in 2015 in contrast to a decline of 0 7  in the S P 500 index  And mind you  2015 was one of the most difficult years after the great recession of 2008 So What Sets Netflix Apart Netflix has been smart enough to play to its strength and generate the kind of content that users demand  A rapid international expansion strategy and efforts to improve its original content have indeed been paying off In fact  the company is now all set to increase prices for its older customers  Netflix appears to be well poised on the growth track despite the price increase largely because its original programming manages to keep users hooked on to it  Netflix has strategically formed its own niche  catering to new age users who want to watch as per their own convenience and sometimes prefer binge watching This Zacks Rank  2  Buy  company added 6 7 million new members in the first quarter of 2016  taking the total to over 81 5 million subscribers There is no doubt that Brexit will have some negative impact on the stock as the markets correct themselves  but over the long run  we believe the streaming giant will benefit from the changing trends NETFLIX INC Price and Consensus   Apart from Netflix  investors can also have a look at these Broadcast Radio TV stocks  which seem promising at the moment Discovery Communications  Inc   NASDAQ DISCA    This prominent original and purchased programming company in the U S  has a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   The company has a presence in more than 220 countries across the globe but it derives more than 50  of its total revenues from the U S  market alone  which is still registering growth In the first quarter of 2016  Discovery Communications  sales in the U S  jumped 8  over the past year quarter to  807 million  driven by strength in both distribution and advertising revenues We remain optimistic about the company s performance considering its strong product portfolio and strategic collaborations with the likes of Hulu and Sony  The company also claims to have a decent currency hedging program  which should cushion its financials in times of such macroeconomic turmoil  Moreover  this stock is also a great bet on the valuation front DISCOVERY COM A Price and Consensus   Salem Media Group   NASDAQ SALM    This U S  based multimedia company operates in the radio  digital media and book  magazine and newsletter publishing space  This Zacks Rank  2  Buy  company operates 116 local radio stations with 71 of these in top 25 media markets We believe that this company is well positioned to gain from the forthcoming U S  national elections  As the battle between Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton heats up  Salem Media has placed itself well to gain from all the political radio ad buying going on SALEM MEDIA GRP Price and Consensus   Sirius XM Holdings Inc    NASDAQ SIRI    This satellite radio services provider mainly operates in the U S  and Canada  which immunes it to some extent from international macroeconomic uncertainties like Brexit This Zacks Rank  2 stock has delivered profits for 21 consecutive quarters and has already seen some impressive subscriber addition in 2016  This led it provide an encouraging guidance for the year A major positive in our view is the company s move to increase its stake in its Canadian unit to 70  from 37   The transaction has the potential to boost the company s growth substantially because of the higher license fees paid by the Canadian unit SIRIUS XM HLDGS Price and Consensus   To Sum UpMacroeconomic changes  as huge as Brexit  will undoubtedly impact all the markets  but in varying degrees  Nonetheless  we can use this time to add

"Political concerns of our own threw the ASX 200 rally temporarily off balance on Friday  but with calmer head prevailing this morning  we should look back on Friday s news flow as nothing more than noise 
The open for the Aussie market is certainly looking constructive  with SPI futures gaining 34 points in the Friday night session and closing at 5921  This close is a whisker away from the year to date  ytd  high of 5945 printed on 2 May  while our ASX 200 opening call of 5936 is subsequently eyeing a break of the YTD high of 5956  So naturally  the target for today for the bulls is for a close through these highs  Should this materialise it would portray much about the level of control the bulls have here and while short sellers are having a tough time of late  if you are an investor and looking to increase cash allocations within the portfolio  you may ask yourself   Can I sell at higher levels  
There is certainly enough event risk for both macro  and micro focused investors and traders to contend with this week  On the micro side  we get 24  of the S P 500 reporting  including Apple  NASDAQ AAPL  on Friday morning at 07 30 aest  but one questions just how much inspiration on the earnings side is baked into markets  given we have seen 8 4  aggregate EPS growth from the 55  of S P 500 corporates due to report  where 78  have beaten on earnings  Personally  it feels to me as though we may get one last push higher from earnings this week  but good earnings are quite a mature theme here  Locally  we have NAB reporting on Thursday  with this name trending nicely at present  although Friday s price action suggests the bulls would be looking at perhaps tightening stops here 
While we get central banks decisions in the UK and Japan  there is certainly a focus on the US  not just because we have a House tax bill due mid week  or because we have the FOMC meeting on Thursday  05 00 aest   where sometime after we should hear that Trump has appointed either John Taylor or Jerome Powell as the new Fed chair  The talk in the media on Friday is that we are looking at a probable Jerome Powell appointment  which goes someway to explaining why US bonds were bid  with the US 10 year Treasury closing six basis points lower at 2 40   The fixed income community look like they are increasing duration and there is a widely held consensus trade that the Treasury curve is going to resume a bull flattening position  with traders pricing in a higher degree of hikes over the coming two years  which should weigh on future inflation trends  Whether this trade is further influenced by Powell s appointment is yet to be seen  but keep in mind that we also get the ISM manufacturing report on Thursday morning  01 00aest    which currently sits at the strongest levels since May 2004 and Friday s non farm payrolls  where economists are calling for a massive payback with 310 000 jobs created in October 
Another interesting point is that Trump should detail the Fed chair before he heads off to Asia  where domestically his approval rating  according to a poll from the WSJ NBC  dropped five points in September to 38   That s a new low for Mr Trump and certainly compares poorly relative to other presidents at this stage in their tenure  Obama was at 51  at this stage  Clinton 47    Of course  the key talking point on the agenda will be North Korea and Trump will try and galvernise the region on the issue  especially with US General Jim Mattis saying over the weekend that he will not accept North Korea as a nuclear power  It would be hugely inflammatory for missile tests to occur during these meetings  but that is what we almost expect from North Korea 
The USD remains a key focal point then given this event risk  with many noting the key technical upside break in the USD index last week  with EUR USD also looking vulnerable to further downside  There could be some focus tonight on inflation prints in the US tonight  23 30 aest   with core PCE expected to remain at a subdued 1 3   with personal spending  consensus sits at  0 9   and personal income   0 4   also due  Keep in mind that the market has discounted a lot into the interest rate markets  with the probability  implied in the fed funds future  sitting at 85  and 57bp of hikes priced in through to end 2018  AUD USD has found some support on Friday  but the trend is lower here and I wouldn t be surprised to see traders looking to sell into moves above 77c 
So as mentioned we are expecting a solid open  with US equities having a strong day on Friday  notably in the NASDAQ 100  where names like Amazon  NASDAQ AMZN   Intel  NASDAQ INTC  and Microsoft  NASDAQ MSFT  flew  Volumes going through the S P 500 or NASDAQ were well above the 30 day average and this sets us up nicely  One small headwind though  is the fact that all the buying was in tech and discretionary  with capital rotating out of financials and materials  which is really where we would have liked to have seen the outperformance  That said  we expect these sectors in the ASX 200 to perform fairly well today given the moves in the SPI futures  Energy should be interesting to given the comments from the Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salmon suggesting he was interested in extending the production quota agreement into late 2018  Brent and US crude have gained 1 9  and 2 4  respectively  The next OPEC meeting is on 30 November  so oil prices should stay firm into that meeting 
The lack of any real movement in the early Asia FX open this morning  suggests we shouldn t see much of a move in S P 500 futures  and various other futures markets  open at 10 00 aest  Further focus remains on the commodity space given the recent USD flows and here we see gold sitting at  1273  although it does seem to be building a base into  1265 and could see a touch more upside at the start of the week into  1285 90  Bulk commodities look vulnerable on the other hand  with spot iron ore closing at  60 08 and eyeing a test of the October low of  59 65  Dalian iron ore and steel futures closed  2 3  and 0 55 respectively  so we should see BHP is eyeing an open around 0 4  lower "
"By Jessica DiNapoli and Soyoung Kim DAVOS  Switzerland  Reuters    From centre stage in Davos last year  President Donald Trump told the world s corporate bosses that America is a great place to invest  It hasn t quite turned out that way  Foreign direct investment to the United States fell in 2018  and companies gathered at the World Economic Forum in the Swiss Alps this year say they are worried Trump s trade war with China will dampen the global economy and business investments even further  One key complaint here this week  Companies increasingly reliant on consumers in China have had to lower their earnings outlooks as the world s second largest economy cools  And while the U S  administration has cut taxes and regulations to attract new investment  a wave of caution is rippling through many industries in the United States   The trade war has been very damaging for the U S  agricultural economy   said David MacLennan  chief executive of U S  food and agricultural giant Cargill Inc  which announced worse than expected results out of China earlier in January   The longer this goes on  the worse it is   he told Reuters  Foreign investment in the United States  which includes cross border mergers and acquisitions and intra company loans  fell about 18 percent in 2018 from the prior year  according to the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development  UNCTAD   That is close to the 19 percent year on year drop in foreign investment globally  But it is notable given the deregulation and tax cuts that might have otherwise fed into inward investment  In January of last year  at Davos  many executives said they planned to spend money in the U S  in 2018  While the U N  trade agency attributed the global and U S  declines to the tariffs that the United States and China have imposed on each other s imports since mid 2018  foreign investment in China actually rose 3 percent last year over the previous year  Foreign investment to India rose 7 percent  Alan Jope  chief executive of consumer goods company  Unilever   L ULVR   said the United States remains a good market for its products  which include Dove deodorant  Magnum ice cream and Lipton tea   But it is China  where Unilever last year joined forces with ecommerce giant JD com  O JD  to move its products around the country  that has become the more resilient market  Jope said China was  one of our most reliable sources of growth  China provides the new stability in consumer consumption   RIPPLE EFFECTS The U S  China trade war has hit industries around the world over the past few months  Big Chinese companies such as  Alibaba   N BABA  have shrunk their plans to invest in the United States  Taiwan based Foxconn  TW 2354  has scaled back its plans for a Wisconsin factory  and Chinese automaker GAC Motor  GACHA UL  has also delayed a move into the U S  market  In September  Austria s fiber producer Lenzing halted a planned U S  expansion  blaming rising tariffs between the United States and China  Chinese textile exports to the U S  are among the goods facing tariffs  Lenzing mothballed a  322 million project in Alabama to focus on setting up a new production facility in Thailand  To be sure  foreign companies are still investing  particularly in the auto industry  Volkswagen  DE VOWG p  said earlier this month that it would invest  800 million to build a new electric car at its plant in Chattanooga  Tennessee  Toyota and Mazda are working on a new assembly plant  and Daimler and BMW are investing in existing operations  But the economic malaise driven by the upending of trade flows is hitting tech companies hard due to both supply chain disruption and the economic slowdown in China   Apple  O AAPL  this month warned of disappointing quarterly revenues  citing slowing iPhone demand in China   Samsung Electronics Co Ltd   KS 005930   the world s biggest maker of smartphones and the manufacturer of chips for other smartphone makers including Apple and Huawei  said its fourth quarter profit likely dropped 29 percent   For the long run    I worry that the trend will expand to many other countries and industries  and at that time    we all will be negatively affected   Ken Hu  deputy chairman of China s Huawei Technologies  HWT UL   said in Davos  Huawei  the world s biggest producer of telecommunications equipment  is  probably suffering the most right now  because it relies on heavily integrated and globalised supply chains  Hu said  TRUMP LOOMS LARGE As a result of the disruption  Trump s trade war with Chinese President Xi Jinping is looming large over Davos this year  even if neither man is here   The International Monetary Fund trimmed its global growth forecasts on Monday and a survey by auditing and accounting giant PwC of nearly 1 400 chief executives showed increasing pessimism among business chiefs  The PwC research showed 27 percent of executives from outside the United States see the United States as the number one place with the most potential for growth  down from 46 percent in 2018  It s not only economics that is clouding the skies  Foreign companies  mainly Chinese  also face tighter scrutiny when they bring deals to the United States  after the Trump administration last year strengthened the powers of the Committee on Foreign Investment  CFIUS   said Stuart Eizenstat  former U S  ambassador to the European Union and now head of law firm Covington   Burlington LLP s international practice  CFIUS is an intra agency panel that reviews acquisitions on national security grounds  Chinese state owned Sinochem Group  SASADA UL   which has been in merger talks with ChemChina to create the world s biggest industrial chemicals firm  said that it did not think it could clinch a U S  acquisition in the current environment   You know what s happening today  so I think you will see there will be less investment going abroad   Sinochem Chairman Ning Gaoning said   The Chinese are getting quite confused  They thought they were welcome to invest in other countries  Now they realize they are not being welcomed all the time   Takeshi Niinami  chief executive of Japanese brewer Suntory Holdings Ltd  SUNTH UL   told Reuters in an interview that the world has  very big emotional leaders  including one in the Washington        Davos is a body to work on one voice  to give  a message that says    Come on  we have to be rational    he said   Business should be the one to let them cool down

For Immediate ReleaseChicago  IL   March 2  2018   Zacks com announces the list of stocks featured in the Analyst Blog  Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets  Stocks recently featured in the blog include Amazon   NASDAQ AMZN    Alphabet   NASDAQ GOOGL    Apple   NASDAQ AAPL    Twitter   NYSE TWTR   and Facebook   NASDAQ FB   Today  Zacks is promoting its   Buy   stock recommendations    Here are highlights from Thursday s Analyst Blog  Tech Roundup  Amazon in Healthcare  Google Pay LaunchesAmazon selling over the counter medications and Alphabet rebranding and enhancing Android Pay as Google Pay were the top stories from last week The Amazon Drug StoreCNBC reported that Amazon quietly launched a line of over the counter  OTC  medications and generic drugs under the Basic Care brand back in August  The 60 products sold under the brand are currently exclusively manufactured by private label Perrigo and also include some generics sold under its GoodSense brand Over the counter medications are everyday things like cough syrups  allergy medicines or treatments for minor stomach disorders that don t require a prescription  People generally don t buy them til the last minute  something that may not change despite Amazon s competitive pricing  This is the main challenge for Amazon in the segment  They comprise 31   or  8 4 billion  of the U S  OTC medication industry  according to Euromonitor The bigger and more regulated part of the market is generics and while there have been news reports off and on about Amazon s interest in the area  this market will be harder to break into  But once it manages to make an entry  it will be much easier to buy prescription medicines on Amazon  especially for chronic or prolonged illnesses  This might be why the company recently launched an alliance with JPMorgan Chase  NYSE JPM  and Berkshire Hathaway  NYSE BRKa  with the stated objective of lowering healthcare costs for everyone over the long term Google PayAs announced earlier  Google is rebranding Android Pay as Google Pay and also incorporating Google Wallet P2P  now called Google Pay Send  services into it  The app s Home tab displays your recent transactions and based on your shopping history and location  lists nearby places that accept Google Pay  There s also a Cards tab that stores your debt  credit and loyalty card information  as well as ongoing offers You can shift through these with your Google account information and don t need to share card details  Other than the supported brick and mortar outlets  Google Pay also allows you to pay online on partner sites like Airbnb DoorDash  Hotel Tonight and Fandango For people already using Android Pay  the shift will simply be a software update  The Google Pay Send integration will happen gradually over the next few months  first in the U S  and UK Other Stories CorporateAnalysts Weigh in on Apple  According to various media reports  UBS analyst Steven Milunovich thinks that Apple will likely spend its billons by buying back shares or combining that with higher dividends to become cash neutral by 2023  Speculation started after In the first scenario  it buys back 10  of its shares each year resulting in a 30  increase in the EPS by 2021 and in the second  its spends  30 60 billion on share buybacks while increasing the dividend yield to 3  from 1 6   The analyst doesn t think there s a big acquisition on the horizon Analyst Sees Facebook Losing Ad Dollars to Twitter  Snap  Daniel Ives of GBH says that a number of factors are leading him to believe that Snap and Twitter s growth prospects are improving relative to Facebook  Facebook s recent move to keep its platform social could have had something to do with it In any case  15 20  of traditional social media advertisers who have earlier only used Facebook  are now experimenting with Twitter ads Today  Zacks is promoting its   Buy

"The FOMC did indeed cut the target Fed Funds rate by 25bps overnight  to a target range of 1 50 1 75   China though  showed that the global slowdown is still alive and well outside of America  with official Manufacturing PMI data dropping to a below forecast 49 3 
The FOMC did assuage my analyst poor loser ego though  with their accompanying statement saying they are now moving to wait and see mode  and are finished with cutting rates for now  That takes December off the table  and we may well see no action until well into Q2 next year if at all  The  insurance cut  as Chairman Powell put it  makes complete sense in this context  A little more wood on the campfire and the FOMC can now sit back to sing cheesy camping songs while awaiting more clarity on issues such as the trade war  A far better state of affairs than guessing the lyrics of the economic song the world will sing in 2020 
Circling back to China  the PMI reading this morning is concerning  I ll also note that the Non Manufacturing PMI sharply missed its consensus 53 9 expectation as well  falling to 52 8   Official  data from China does have the habit of not deviating from official forecasts too much  Read into that what you will  but a print so far below the 49 8 expected implies that no matter how they cut it  officials couldn t make a gloomy picture seem brighter 
The Caixin Manufacturing PMI will now be closely followed tomorrow morning for further signs all is not well  Its sample size is much broader than the mostly large government controlled entities of the official data  Unsurprisingly  it has outperformed  remaining in expansionary territory  It is expected to drop to 51 0 from 51 4  but a lower print than that will probably raise the expectations of more stimulus from the Chinese government  The overall picture shows China is not immune to the global slowdown  and the trade war is taking its toll there as well as in the U S 
The Bank of Japan announced its rate decision today  No change  
The week s data frenzy continues later today with preliminary EU GDP growth for Q3 expected at a comatose like 0 10  increase  Yesterday the U S  GDP came in at 1 90   0 10  lower than last month  but above the 1 60  expected  If anyone is wondering why I seem perpetually upbeat on the U S   please reread this paragraph  The prosecution rests 
U S income and spending data is the highlight in North America today and closely watched by the Federal Reserve  Income is expected to rise by 0 40  and spending by 0 10   With so many foundations built on the U S  consumer  the spending side of the data could see a retreat by equities should growth fall below zero 
Overall  the FOMC has clearly stated that yesterday s cut was some insurance before they move to the sidelines for an indeterminate amount of time  They prefer to wait and see how events play out  It is eminently sensible as the three cuts this year work their way through the system  given the unpredictability of the path of U S  China trade talks  this is really what they meant in not so many words 
Equities
Apple  NASDAQ AAPL  and Facebook  NASDAQ FB  produced sparkling quarterly results overnight  defying the skeptics  U S  Q3 earnings continue to outperform  Combined with a Fed rate cut  that saw Wall Street rise overnight  The S P 500 rose 0 33  to record highs  the NASDAQ also rose 0 33   and the Dow Jones climbed 0 40  
In Asia this morning  the Nikkei has been more circumspect  up only 0 25  ahead of the BOJ rate decision  China s Shanghai Comp is flat after the Manufacturing PMI dampened the mood on the mainland  However  the trade sensitive KOSPI and FTSE Straits Times Singapore have raced higher by 0 70  with the Hang Seng outperforming  rising 1 0  after the HKMA cut rates this morning by 0 25  to match the FOMC cut yesterday 
The positive tone ex China will continue throughout the day as the FOMC cut rates but with no surprises from the statement 
CurrenciesThe U S  dollar weakened against the major currencies overnight after the Fed cut rates with the Dollar Index lower by 0 20  to 97 51  The euro and sterling both climbed by 0 30  against the greenback and have continued their move higher this morning  with the euro rising 0 15  to 1 1165  and GBP rising 0 20  to 1 2925 
Trade sensitive AUD and NZD have risen 0 35  and 0 65  to 0 6925 and 0 6425 respectively  China set the yuan midpoint at 7 0533  almost unchanged from yesterday  The offshore yuan  the CNH  briefly spiked lower after the China PMI data  but now sits unchanged at 7 0425 
Asia Pacific currencies have edged higher today against the dollar after the rate cut widened interest rate differentials  With so much tier 1 data ahead today and tomorrow  rallies will likely be modest  The Federal Reserve cut does give regional central banks room to ease policy as well to ensure their currencies do not strengthen too much  Thus  the EM rally from here probably has a limited upside 
Oil
Oil ignored the Fed rate cut overnight  suggesting that it was already priced into the market  Both Brent and WTI fell sharply instead  as official U S  Crude Inventories posted a mammoth 5 70 million barrel build against an expected rise of 0 50 million barrels  Brent crude fell 1 66  to  60 50 a barrel  and WTI fell 1 12  to  54 90 a barrel 
Brent and WTI have risen in Asia though  with Brent 0 40  higher and WTI 0 30  higher after the weak China PMI raised hopes of more stimulus from China s government 
Both Brent and WTI s October uptrends remain in place though despite the falls overnight  Only a break of monthly supports at  60 00 and  54 00 respectively will raise concerns  That said  oil  like other markets  has a lot of tier 1 data to negotiate over the next 36 hours to keep the month long rally intact 
GoldGold reacted positively  responding to the Fed rate cut  rising 0 50  to  1495 60 an ounce  The Fed stating they are now on hold likely tempered the rally  which failed to regain the  1500 00 level in a slightly worrying technical sign 
Although gold has risen slightly today  to  1497 50  the rally remains somewhat underwhelming suggesting the yellow metal will need help from the avalanche of data over the next 36 hours 
Longer term support remains at  1475 00 and resistance at  1520 00  The lack of topside momentum suggests that a slew of positive data results into the week s end could lead to a test of the  1475 00 "
"On Monday last  the tech heavy Nasdaq Composite closed above the 5 000 point level for the first time since March 2000 
As a result  the exchange is now within spitting distance of its all time closing high of 5 048 62 and intraday high of 5 132 52  which were hit right before the dot com  
In the month of March  no less 
Does that scary coincidence mean the Nasdaq is setting up for another epic crash and burn 
And if not  how much higher can we reasonably expect the Index to rise 
The answers might surprise you 
Dear  Investors  It s Just a Number
The Nasdaq s return to dot com glory levels naturally brings out the naysayers 
For instance  Janus Capital s Bill Gross told CNBC this week that the Nasdaq hitting 5 000 represents a  little bit of a bubble  
But should we really expect anything less than pessimism from a dyed in the wool bond investor  Calling stocks attractive runs counter to his makeup and business pursuits at his new firm 
Regardless  any fearmongering  or hype  surrounding the 5 000 point milestone ignores one key fact 
There s nothing fundamentally significant about 5 000  We re talking about a purely symbolic and psychological level 
Now  sure  I ll accept that sentiment influences investors  actions  But all time highs aren t anything new  In fact  they re actually kind of a requirement for markets that trend higher over time  which they do 
In fact  the Nasdaq s fellow major indexes   the Dow Jones 30 and S P 500   have hit new  all time highs with regularity over the last year  So the Nasdaq is playing catch up  and its high this week was long overdue 
So let s keep the focus squarely on the actual fundamentals that are driving the rally   and whether or not they re likely to continue   instead of obsessing over an arbitrary number  or fretting about dot com bubble history repeating 
Quoted in the Los Angeles Times  John Lonski  Chief Capital Markets Economist at Moody s Analytics  says    The Nasdaq  doesn t resemble the speculative excesses that were in effect when it last set a record high  
Speaking of which 
Three Factors That Will Propel the Nasdaq to Record Highs
We can attribute the Nasdaq s return to 5 000 to three key factors  And if they continue  it s reasonable to expect the rally to do likewise 
Nasdaq Catalyst  1  The Fed
 The Nasdaq wouldn t be here if not for quantitative easing  It wouldn t be here without zero percent interest rates  
So says Peter Schiff  CEO of Euro Pacific Capital 
I don t typically agree with Schiff  But I do in this case  at least partially 
The  have certainly inflated asset prices  Tech stocks included 
But it s a bit of a stretch to claim that the Fed has manufactured the Nasdaq s rise to 5 000  Especially given a much more obvious and powerful catalyst at work 
Nasdaq Catalyst  2  Tech Is Everywhere 
  unless you re Amish  technology now pervades all aspects of our everyday lives  Ditto for every sector of business 
From communications to healthcare  banking to shopping  energy to automobiles  is there any corner of the market that isn t increasingly influenced by technology 
With that in mind  the Nasdaq s climb to 5 000 is more emblematic of technology s maturation and dominance in everyday life   for consumers and businesses alike 
Consider that the technologies that were dreamed about during the dot com era   and which received too much premature funding   have now finally come to fruition and flourished 
As Kevin Kelly  Chief Investment Officer at Recon Capital Partners  points out  the Nasdaq s rally is  showing the robustness of America s intelligence and innovation  
Indeed  And the increasing real world value of both  too 
Nasdaq Catalyst  3  Apple
Since we re on the topic of tech ubiquity  Apple  NASDAQ AAPL  reigns supreme as the poster child for it 
If you don t own an Apple device  it s probably because you live in an emerging market and can t afford one yet  Or maybe you re just anti Apple 
Regardless  we can t underestimate the significance of Apple becoming the   based on its most recent quarterly report 
The company now comprises a remarkable 10 1  of the Nasdaq   compared to a mere 0 2  at the Index s record high in 2000 
Simply put  as Apple s stock goes  so goes the Nasdaq  And Apple s been going pretty well lately  thanks to its above average growth rates  The stock is up 74   and counting  over the last 12 months 
The Case for the Rally Continuing
Like I said  continued momentum for the Nasdaq hinges upon the three catalysts above 
Let s assess each one 
The Fed  Will the bank keep inflating asset prices  Most likely  Despite removing the key policy language of  considerable time   Fed Chair Janet Yellen pledged to be  patient  on raising interest rates 
 Dovish  to  less dovish  is still positive for stocks in general   and  by extension  the Nasdaq 
Tech  Will America keep innovating and commercializing new ideas  Absolutely  I see it on a day to day basis  as I meet with the country s newest innovators 
If you need a data point to hang your hat on before believing the same  try this 
Patent filing applications by U S  companies and citizens increased by 7  in 2013  the most recent data available   That s enough to help the United States retain the top spot in the list of the world s most innovative countries  based on patent grants 
Apple  Will Apple keep leading the way  You bet  There s nothing holding the company back from more domination 
But the next question becomes   How high can the Nasdaq reasonably go  
Nasdaq 6 900 
Interestingly  not only have the S P 500 and Dow hit new all time nominal highs  they ve also exceeded inflation adjusted 2000 highs 
As for the Nasdaq  Not so much 
The Index would need to rally to about 6 900   38  higher   to achieve the same feat 
Now  let me be clear  I m not offering the inflation adjusted level as my prediction of where the Nasdaq is heading with certainty  Rather  it s to provide perspective that there s still ample room to run 
That s especially true when we take valuations into account 
During the final days of the internet boom  the Nasdaq traded at an eye popping P E ratio of 175  Today  it sports a P E of 23 
Granted  that s a premium multiple to the S P 500  which currently trades at a P E of 19  But the Nasdaq has always commanded a premium multiple because of its perceived high growth potential  so this isn t unusual 
Bottom line  It s taken 15 years for the Nasdaq to reclaim the 5 000 point level  But this time around  the fundamentals suggest the rally is far from overheated "
"Apple  NASDAQ AAPL  reported earnings this week and the latest numbers have some some pounding the table bullish  For example  here s Forbes from an article titled    

Apple still trades at 13x earnings  The S P 500 trades at 16x  Apple trades at 13x next year s projected earnings  The S P 500 trades at 16 5x  Clearly it s undervalued compared to the broader market  What about Apple s monster cash position  Apple has even more cash now a record  237 billion  If we excluded the cash from the valuation  Apple trades at 8 6x earnings  Though not an apples to apples  pun   and just for a reference point  that valuation would group Apple with the likes of these S P 500 components that trade 8x earnings  Dow Chemical  NYSE DOW   Prudential Financial  NYSE PRU   Bed Bath   Beyond  NASDAQ BBBY   a Norwegian chemical company  LBY   and Hewlett Packard Enterprise  It s safe to say no one is debating whether or not Hewlett Packard is at the pinnacle of its business  Yet  if we strip out the cash in Apple  AAPL shares are trading at an HPE valuation 

There are a few things that are problematic with this analysis  First of all  the S P actually trades at 25 times trailing earnings not 16  I assume the author is using operating not net earnings in arriving at 16x  So an apples to apples comparison  please excuse the pun  makes Apple look even cheaper relative to the broad market  But I ve never found this to be a terribly valuable way to determine whether a stock is cheap or not 
The other problem with this analysis is that if you want to back out Apple s cash you also have to consider all of the debt the company has piled up in recent years  In fact  as MarketWatch   Apple actually added more debt to their balance sheet than cash last quarter  The  237 billion in cash is not nearly so impressive when you consider the company is now on the hook for  87 billion in debt  Net cash then is only  150 billion  I agree that factoring in a company s net cash or net debt gives you a better picture of their overall financial valuation but looking at just the cash and not the debt is deceiving 
Subtracting the net cash out of Apple s  620 billion market cap yields an enterprise value of  470 billion  Still  to compare this number to earnings is also deceiving when the company earns more than a billion dollars per year simply in interest income  Yes  that might be a trivial amount for a company of Apple s size but we should still be diligent about comparing apples to apples  Backing out the interest income  Apple earned  44 billion last year  It currently trades at an enterprise value roughly 10 7x that number  not 8 as the Forbes author would have you believe 
Again  11x might look cheap relative to the 25x the broad stock market trades at but I find little utility in this approach  In fact  Apple has traded at a discount to the broad market for years now and investors might want to try to understand why it has been persistently  undervalued   Apple trades at  115 per share today  It first hit this level almost two years ago  That was the last time I wrote about the stock  revealing   I first bought the stock in early 2013 because I thought it was cheap back then  At the time  I wrote 

The current market capitalization is  422 billion  938 million shares times  453 per share   Back out the cash of  137 billion  Apple had no debt at the time  and you get an enterprise value of  285 billion  That amounts to a mere 6 times the company s free cash flow over the past twelve months  In other words  investors get a 16 6  free cash flow return on their investment at the current share price  What s more  Apple  on an enterprise value to EBITDA measure  is now cheaper than the likes of Microsoft  NASDAQ MSFT  and Radio Shack 
Even when you don t back out the cash in its bank accounts the stock currently trades at its cheapest valuation at any time over the past decade  Over that time  Apple s stock price has typically found a bottom near 10 times gross cash flow  In 2011  it bottomed at 8 5 times cash flow before running 75  higher over the next 12 months  Today  it trades at 7 5 times cash flow  Any way you slice it that s damn cheap and for one of the most admired brands most profitable companies in history 

I like to compare a company s valuation to its own history and to its peers in determining whether it s cheap or not  In early 2013  it was cheap by both standards but let s update these numbers to see if it s still true today  Apple s enterprise value today is nearly 9x its free cash flow  versus 6x back in early 2013  And if you look at any number of other valuation measures  the stock currently trades right in line with its own 5 year averages  Based on its own history  then  the stock is not cheap  it s just in line with average 

The real thing investors need to consider though with Apple is the fact that sales back in 2013 were still growing very fast  The stock traded 6x free cash flow while sales were still growing 18  year over year  Furthermore  Apple hadn t even begun to sell iPhones in China yet so it still had a huge growth opportunity in front of it  Today  the stock trades 9x FCF and sales are falling nearly 8  year over year  Operating income is falling at an even faster 15  clip  Furthermore  there is no layup growth opportunity out there like there was back then that I can see 
Sure  Apple is spending very heavily on research and development that may pay off in the future  As an investor  though  this is very difficult to value  and this might have been why the greatest value investor of all time recently sold out of his position   Can Apple come up with another product as popular and as profitable as the iPhone  Or is the company just a one hit wonder  Personally  I think this is an open question  And investors are free to gamble on this outcome but that s not really investing  is it "
Value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment  After all  who wouldn t want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys  or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios  many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process  Let s put Horizon Pharma Public Limited Company   NASDAQ HZNP    stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value oriented investors right now  or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks PE RatioA key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio  or PE for short  This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock  and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world  The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock s current PE ratio with  a  where this ratio has been in the past  b  how it compares to the average for the industry sector  and c  how it compares to the market as a whole On this front  Horizon Pharma has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 13 1  as you can see in the chart below This level actually compares pretty favorably with the market at large  as the PE for the S P 500 stands at about 21 4  If we focus on the long term PE trend  Horizon Pharma s current PE level puts it above its midpoint over the past five years Further  the stock s PE also compares favorably with the  s trailing twelve months PE ratio  which stands at 34 7  At the very least  this indicates that the stock is relatively undervalued right now  compared to its peers We should also point out that Horizon Pharma has a forward PE ratio  price relative to this year s earnings  of just 10 7  so it is fair to say that a slightly more value oriented path may be ahead for Apple  NASDAQ AAPL  stock in the near term too P S RatioAnother key metric to note is the Price Sales ratio  This approach compares a given stock s price to its total sales  where a lower reading is generally considered better  Some people like this metric more than other value focused ones because it looks at sales  something that is far harder to manipulate with accounting tricks than earnings Right now  Horizon Pharma has a P S ratio of about 2 4  This is a bit lower than the S P 500 average  which comes in at 3 4x right now  Also  as we can see in the chart below  this is well below the highs for this stock in particular over the past few years If anything  HZNP is in the lower end of its range in the time period from a P S metric  suggesting some level of undervalued trading at least compared to historical norms Broad Value OutlookIn aggregate  Horizon Pharma currently has a Value Score of A  putting it into the top 20  of all stocks we cover from this look  This makes Horizon Pharma a solid choice for value investors  and some of its other key metrics make this pretty clear too For example  the PEG ratio for Horizon Pharma is just 0 6  a level that is lower than the industry average of 1 5  The PEG ratio is a modified PE ratio that takes into account the stock s earnings growth rate  Clearly  HZNP is a solid choice on the value front from multiple angles What About the Stock Overall Though Horizon Pharma might be a good choice for value investors  there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name  In particular  it is worth noting that the company has a Growth Score of D and a Momentum Score of A  This gives HZNP a Zacks VGM score   or its overarching fundamental grade   of B   You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores  Meanwhile  the company s recent earnings estimates have been mixed at best  The current quarter has seen no estimates go higher in the past sixty days compared to two lower  while the full year estimate has seen five up and no down in the same time period This has had a significant impact on the consensus estimate though as the current quarter consensus estimate has fallen by 54  in the past two months  while the full year estimate has gone up by 10   You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action for the stock in the chart below Horizon Pharma PLC Price and Consensus   Despite this somewhat mixed trend  the stock has just a Zacks Rank  2  Buy  and that is why we are looking for better performance from the company in the near term Bottom LineHorizon Pharma is an inspired choice for value investors  as it is hard to beat its incredible lineup of statistics on this front  However  with a sluggish industry rank  Bottom 29  out of more than 250 industries   it is hard to get too excited about this company overall  In fact  over the past two years  the industry has clearly underperformed the broader market  as you can see below So  value investors might want to wait for estimates  analyst sentiment and broader factors to turn around in this name first  but once that happens  this stock could be a compelling pick Can Hackers Put Money INTO Your Portfolio Earlier this month  credit bureau Equifax  NYSE EFX  announced a massive data breach affecting 2 out of every 3 Americans  The cybersecurity industry is expanding quickly in response to this and similar events  But some stocks are better investments than others Zacks has just released Cybersecurity  An Investor s Guide to help Zacks com readers make the most of the  170 billion per year investment opportunity created by hackers and other threats  It reveals 4 stocks worth looking into right away

CHONBURI  Thailand  Reuters    When trade war tariffs jolted Chinese tire maker Prinx Chengshan into speeding up foreign investment plans  the company wound up in Thailand  thanks to that country s relentless courtship 
With an initial investment of  300 million  the company is now racing to build a factory to export tires to the United States next year  based in a Thai industrial zone reinvigorated by the trade war 
Multiple visits to China by Thailand s Board of Investment helped  So did two personal meetings with Thailand s top economic policymaker  said Ju Xunning  a company manager 
 This impressed our company  and this is also one of the main reasons for choosing Thailand   Ju told Reuters   It s apparent that the government values doing business with us  
With global economic growth flagging  in part because of U S  President Donald Trump s trade war with China  competition is growing among Asian countries to win investment from companies moving supply chains to escape higher tariffs 
Tax breaks  promises to slash red tape and trade missions are all on the table 
 Companies have thrown in the towel on the status quo   said Rajiv Biswas  Asia Pacific chief economist for IHS Markit 
Vietnam has benefited most from the shifts in terms of the number of companies moving business  according to independent surveys  But other Asian countries are eager to bring in more business as well  including India and Indonesia 
Companies moving production from China   
 YOU RE THE EMPEROR 
The trade war has breathed new life into Thailand s Eastern Economic Corridor  EEC   where Prinx Chengshan is building its factory  The program was set up under the former military junta to boost growth that has for years lagged regional peers 
Pledged investment for the zone rose nearly four fold year on year to 88 billion baht   2 9 billion  in the first half of 2019  One of the main drivers was investment from companies trying to escape tariffs 
Thailand s biggest industrial estate developer WHA  BK WHA   which has nine developments in the area  said Chinese companies account for 43 percent of its land sales  up from less than 3 percent before the trade war 
Chinese companies are being catered to carefully  the company s chief executive  Jareeporn Jarukornsakul  told Reuters 
 I told one company   This location is very good  You ll be at the heart of the estate  and everyone else will be your tributaries  The feng shui is perfect  you re the emperor    she said 
Hong Kong listed Prinx Chengshan said it had planned on moving tire production to Malaysia  but wavered after the Malaysian election in early 2018 
 The government couldn t fulfill several of the promises made to us and we eventually gave up   Ju said at his makeshift office near the building site 
Malaysia s deputy trade and industry minister  Ong Kian Ming  told Reuters that although Prinx Chengshan had gone elsewhere  the country had attracted another Chinese tire company   Maxtrek Tyres  a subsidiary of Zhaoqing Junhong Corp  Ltd   as well as a paper plant and further Chinese investment 
Both Thailand and Malaysia have since sweetened their deals 
Thailand this month offered a new range of  relocation incentives    including a five year 50  corporate tax cut   while Malaysia set up an investment board to encourage relocations 
 If approvals took three months earlier  now it would take a month   Ong said   The trend we see is that many of these strategic investments are reacting to the U S  China conflict  
Foreign direct investment to Malaysia nearly doubled to  12 billion in the first half of 2019  and Ong said he hoped it would accelerate further 
HIGH END  LOW END
Thailand and Malaysia are competing for higher end manufacturers  but their wages price them out of labor intensive work such as stitching shirts and sneakers that is more likely to go to Bangladesh  Myanmar or Cambodia 
One Bangladeshi factory owner  Faisal Samad  said new orders from the United States had pushed his export volumes up 20  this year 
Vietnam has taken aim at both the low and high ends  with companies citing relatively low wages  a motivated workforce  relatively simple business procedures and proximity to China 
When Vietnamese industrial park operator DEEP C Industrial Zones set off to China for investment roadshows this month  it saw 180 people sign up this year compared with just 20 last year  said head of sales Hank Kerstens 
Another beneficiary has been Taiwan  whose government is trying to lure back Taiwanese firms in China with incentives on tax  land  water and electricity  Officials hope to get  16 billion investment by the end of the year 
A Nomura study of 56 firms relocating production from China between April 2018 and August 2019  when trade war tensions have been highest  showed 26 going to Vietnam  11 to Taiwan and eight to Thailand 
Just three companies went to India and two to Indonesia   a situation both countries are trying to change 
India wants to woo companies such as Apple  NASDAQ AAPL   Foxconn and Wistron Corp with a charm offensive  according to a source and a government document 
A surprise cut to India s headline corporate tax rate to 22  from 30  last week could attract smartphone makers  industry executives said  The federal commerce ministry said the cut was meant to draw in investment 
But businesses also worry about infrastructure and red tape 
One smartphone company executive  who declined to be identified because of the sensitivity of the matter  compared Vietnam to India  saying   You meet one guy  in Vietnam  and he takes care of everything from the government side   That is not the case in India  he added 
Similar concerns are hampering Indonesia  where President Joko Widodo this month told cabinet ministers  we have a problem  as he pointed to the lack of companies moving production to Indonesia to escape trade war tariffs 
He ordered ministers to identify which regulations were getting in the way of investment 
 It s a matter of identifying those regulations  fixing them  and making sure no new ones come up   said Citi Indonesia chief economist Helmi Arman  who cited  ad hoc regulations  as the main obstacle to attracting trade war related relocations 
Indonesian ministries did not respond to a request for comment 
In Thailand  Jareeporn said she was optimistic that the recent surge of investment was just the start 
 We now have a shot at becoming the region s number one and overtaking Vietnam in five years   she said after closing a land deal with another Chinese business "

Key Events
Last night  trading ended the day on a sour note after US stocks failed to carry the bullish torch that was handed over from Asia  after most of the local benchmarks including China s Shanghai Composite and Japan s TOPIX and Nikkei 225 rallied  though Hong Kong s Hang Seng and South Korea s KOSPI bucked the trend  European indices  such as the DAX and the STOXXEurope 600 kept the upward momentum going  save for UK shares 
The FTSE 100 defied the uptrend  a result of the stronger pound which would hurt exports of dollar earning UK multinational corporations and make the country s stocks more expensive for international investors 
The tech selloff in the US was motivated by investors cycling out of this year s biggest outperformers including Apple  NASDAQ AAPL   Facebook  NASDAQ FB  and Amazon  NASDAQ AMZN  
Global Financial Affairs

The Technology sector is up 30 85 percent YTD  significantly better than the S P 500 benchmark s 19 50 percent  As well  investors appear to be rotating out right now on a relative valuation basis 
Consensus is that non tech companies will benefit more from tax cuts versus tech companies  which have already benefited from loopholes that have offered considerable leeway in how they report profits  The proposed tax cut currently on offer by Republicans is 20 percent  higher than the tech industry s average effective rate of 18 5 percent 
Fundamentally  however  the value of these sold off tech shares hasn t changed  This selloff has all the telltale signs of a knee jerk reaction by investors which then attracted the less savvy crowds  The NASDAQ 100 fell as much as 2 2 percent on an intraday basis  closing with a 1 71 percent loss 
Megacap shares of the FANGs dropped the most in almost two years  Contrarian investors who consider both fundamentals and technicals  while ignoring the crowds  would view this selloff as an excellent buying opportunity 
Outgoing Fed Chair Janet Yellen testified yesterday to the congressional Joint Economic Committee that she anticipates the central bank will resume its current path to higher interest rates while shrinking the balance sheet  This was backed up by the Fed s Beige Book economic report which showed that the US economy grew at a modest to moderate pace through mid November  amid price pressures necessary for rising inflation  and a continued tightening of the labor market necessary for higher wages 
Yellen s rhetoric  bolstered by the data  boosted Financials  which have already been enjoying demand after Fed Chair nominee Jerome Powell signaled he won t add to financial regulations  Indeed  his comments earlier in the week were the motivation behind European banks outperforming yesterday  adding to the sector s allure and making it the biggest beneficiary of the rotation out of Technology 

Financials rose 1 71 percent while Technology dropped 2 21 percent 
Unfortunately  neither Yellen s comments nor the positive Beige Book report were enough to boost the dollar  which fluctuated 

The greenback formed a High Wave candle high highs  high lows but a close near the opening price in a clear sign that traders are leaderless on the currency  US 10 year Treasury yields however  popped 2 67 percent  the biggest rise since October 20 
Yellen also said the Fed would support faster economic growth caused by tax reform  provided it was the right kind of growth  This may have been veiled criticism that tax cuts are seen to contribute nothing to economic growth  only to equity prices  Of course  that might help stock owners  or the rich  but it would only widen the gap between the economic classes 
Yesterday s US technology selloff spread through Asia this morning  Despite China s official factory gauge  manufacturing PMI  unexpectedly rising  shares on both the mainland and in Hong Kong declined  in what may be an extension of its decline on regulations 
South Korea s shares resumed yesterday s tumble which started on North Korea jitters  Japan bucked the trend though  closing higher 

South Korea s won fell after its central bank announced it would maintain its accommodation after raising rates for the first time in six years 
Even as the tech selloff appears to be spreading to Europe  defensive utilities have offset the declines  leaving the Stoxx Europe 600 little changed  The euro advanced ahead of a meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and the Social Democrat leader Martin Schulz  a potential coalition partner 
The pound continues to move higher as the UK and the EU appear to be heading toward a compromise on the Irish border issue  the final sticking point before Brexit negotiations can resume 
Oil ended a three day slide after OPEC and Russia appear set to announce mutual readiness to extend production cuts through all of next year

to make the platform more conversational is likely to have helped it expand the monetized user base in the to be reported quarter Notably  the company launched a faster and more personalized Twitter com in the quarter  The easy to navigate website comprises features like the dark mode themes   Dim and Lights Out Moreover  the company s initiatives to detect rule violations and enhance the safety of users are expected to have reduced abusive behavior on the platform Twitter has also strengthened its reporting features  which allows it to accelerate the process of removing accounts based on tweets reported by users  The company has expanded its  against hateful conduct to include language that  dehumanizes others on the basis of religion  Further  as announced during the quarter  Twitter is testing a tool that will allow users to hide replies to their tweets to reduce online trolls and abuse  The feature is currently available to Canadian users Additionally  the company updated its advertising policies concerning state media  On Aug 19  Twitter announced that it will not accept advertising from state controlled news media entities  Although this move might have hurt third quarter advertising revenues  it proliferates healthy and open conversations  thereby driving user engagement    Further  continued strong demand for video ad products like Video Website Cards and in stream pre roll is likely to have contributed to the top line Notably  during the quarter  Twitter announced the availability of a 6 second video bid unit for advertisers globally  This is expected to have expanded the company s advertiser base  considering the growing popularity of short form videos  This is likely to have aided third quarter results Moreover  the company s top line in the third quarter is expected to reflect the benefits of an expanding live streaming sports content portfolio Nevertheless  Twitter faces significant competition from the likes of Facebook  Google  NASDAQ GOOGL  and Amazon  NASDAQ AMZN  for ad dollars  This is likely to have negatively impacted the top line in the to be reported quarter What Our Model SaysAccording to the Zacks model  a company needs the

T2108 Status  60 3 VIX Status  13 5General  Short term  Trading Call  Aggressive traders who got long the breakout should be finished locking in profits Active T2108 periods  Day  25 over 20   overperiod   Day  11 over 60  Day  52 under 70 Commentary T2108 is not where I thought it would be pre  or post Fed  T2108 continues to sag  closing essentially flat with the previous day at 60 3   The S P 500 went essentially nowhere for the fifth day in a row in what is starting to look like a consolidation pattern ahead of a fresh run up  The S P 500 managed to get as high as a new intraday high before pulling back on a weak close  The fades of the past two days are mirror images of the strong bounces from lows last week  What looked like a springboard now looks like a stalemate until consolidation finishes  Tomorrow is the first day of the month  so the bias will be towards strong upside  This could be the catalyst for a fresh rally upward as long as the jobs report on Friday does not disappoint traders  hard to know now whether they want a soft or a good report since a good report presumably brings the Fed that much closer to removing easy money stimulus  So  overall  there is little T2108 can do to help us until this consolidation gets broken one way or the other  I currently have no particular inclination either way  but if forced to bet  I would bet on upside and overbought conditions While the S P 500 has bored us to tears  individual stocks and other indices have delivered plenty of action On the ominous side  the Nikkei  EWJ   NKY  looks like it has slowed down significantly  With the Japanese index cracking its 50DMA again  more downside potential opens up  The overall pattern is a classic one to short as the previous high is a lower high  The Nikkei can only restore momentum by overcoming this high  Similarly  if it breaks the recent low  from June   the Nikkei will have a definitive downtrend in place that will likely encourage more selling This weakness is important because it is now coinciding with a strengthening cycle for the Japanese yen  USD JPY   FXY  and an S P 500 which has failed to make progress since new all time highs a week ago  The iShares MSCI Emerging Markets  EEM  has failed to break its 50DMA resistance for 7 straight days  EEM is now following its 50DMA downward  When combined with the recent acceleration in the downward push of the Australian dollar  AUD USD   I strongly suspect a fresh breakdown is coming for EEM Add these downward trends to the sagging Nikkei  and I start to doubt whether the S P 500 can stay aloft much longer  Next up is Facebook  FB   In my last T2108 Update  I discussed my FB trading strategy  Soon after that  I changed course  I realized that the best way to play an eventual reversal is not to wait patiently for a good entry and buy puts just in case FB falls before I set up my position  Instead  I need to build up a short position and buy call options as hedges I did just that on Tuesday buy shorting a few shares and buying a few September  40 call options  Much to my surprise  FB shot up shortly thereafter and by today s open  my FB calls were already closed out for a 150  gain  I wish I had bought more    Today s fade on FB after perfectly hitting the IPO price of  38 is suggestive  but the rally may be far from over  FB is capturing imaginations again  and analysts are rapidly upgrading the stock and hiking up revenue and earnings expectations  I will have more to say about this in a separate post  Suffice to say that when dreams expand  the courage increases to try buying high and selling even higher Last but certainly not least  is Apple  AAPL   AAPL had another strong start to the week and stalled right at the resistance I pointed out last time  Granted  I did NOT expect AAPL to test the resistance level so soon  Follow through will be important here  Without it in the next few days  I strongly suspect AAPL could fall quickly back to its 50DMA  I think the gap up is  safe    I remain bullish  and this week s strong start provided early evidence or confirmation of my standing assumption that AAPL will be one of the perfect  catch up  stocks for hedge funds who find themselves lagging the market with the clock quickly ticking For details on my now formalized Apple Trading Model  ATM  see     Finally  a friend of mind sent me interesting reading from a Seeking Alpha author who speculates on reasons why the market is not correcting  like it should  in     While I do not like the notion of arguing with the market over what it should and should not be doing  I was very intrigued by the possibility claimed here that the VIX is not representative of true fear in the market  Instead of buying puts on the S P 500  SPY   which are used to calculate the VIX  traders are using ProShares Ultra VIX Short Term Futures ETF  UVXY  instead  Volume has indeed surged on UVXY since March and particularly going into June s bottom  but the rapid decline in UVXY suggests that traders buying and holding UVXY have been quite wrong in betting on fear  The losses on UVXY over 2013 are massive We must also be cautious about interpreting volume  The money committed to UVXY may actually not be increasing all that much  In just over a month  UVXY has collapsed more than 50  but volume has not doubled  That means LESS money may be going into UVXY  Moreover  there are many ways traders can express their fear in financial markets  including the bonds of the U S government  which  until recently  were a great place to hide out Anyway  it is something to keep in mind while watching the VIX continue to languish  I have yet to buy more puts against my small number of iPath S P 500 VIX Short Term Futures ETN  VXX  shares

"AT40   70 01  of stocks are trading above their respective 40 day moving averages  DMAs    Day  1 of an overbought periodAT200   63 8  of stocks are trading above their respective 200DMAsVIX   10 2Short term Trading Call  bullish  upgraded from cautiously bullish 
Commentary The stock market was last overbought three months ago  At the time  AT40  T2108   the percentage of stocks trading above their respective 40 day moving averages  DMAs   ended a 12 day trip through overbought territory  During that period the S P 500  via SPDR S P 500  NYSE SPY   gained an additional 1 9  and set new all time highs along the way  Even after the overbought period ended  the S P 500 continued to creep higher with only minor hiccups as a bearish divergence widened for an entire month  In fact  the index has yet to look back since then 

The S P 500  SPY  is on an incredible hot streak  7 of the last 8 days have delivered closes at or above the upper Bollinger Band  BB  

AT40  T2108   managed to churn below overbought conditions for most of 2017  Will 2018 be the same 
AT40 crossed the overbought threshold on Friday by the slimmest of margins by closing at 70 01   When I first developed my method for trading AT40  I equated an overbought condition with a bearish signal  In recent years  the raging bull market taught me that a trending market going overbought confirms the buying power being applied to the market  see    So  it takes at least one more confirming signal before I flip to bearish  These rules prevented me from making what would have been disastrous trading calls last Fall  For example  when T2108 fell from overbought conditions  I left my short term trading call at bullish 
One bearish signal is the combination of AT40 dropping out of overbought territory AND the S P 500 closing below a key line of technical support  So I am watching for the S P 500 to hold the intraday low from last week s one day pullback  A close below that point and AT40 dropping from overbought will flip my trading call to bearish 
I am also watching for a potential blow off top  As the chart above shows  the S P 500 is ripping higher at an incredible pace  The persistent ability to press the upper Bollinger Band  BB  is impressive  but buyers will eventually exhaust themselves  When that fatigue appears  I will the index simply drift and consolidate or will a blow off top occur  A blow off top is characterized by a buying panic with high trading volume and a large price gain quickly followed by rapid selling on high volume that cracks the low of the day of the top  A gap down the following day is particularly damaging  Such a pattern might flip me all the way to bearish even before AT40 falls out of overbought territory 
Interestingly  the volatility index  the VIX  has held firm through this robust buying effort  Over the last 8 trading days  the VIX has gained on every single day where the S P 500 recorded a gain  The faders made a strong appearance on the one pullback day  This VIX resilience is something to watch and could be setting up the next VIX spike in the next week or two  As a result  I am still rotating through call options on ProShares Ultra VIX Short Term Futures  NYSE UVXY   Recall that in this raging bull market  a VIX spike does not have to generate a significant sell off  In fact  these days a drop of just 1  in the indices seems to create enough hand wringing to simulate the sentiment drop of a real sell off 

The volatility index  the VIX  continues to hold firm above its all time lows

Apple  NASDAQ AAPL  AAPL recorded a new all time high on Friday  The stock broke through a triple top and has likely avoided the extremely rare quadruple top  This breakout essentially confirms the on going bullish market sentiment in the market  I did not make a fresh weekly trade on call options given the trading holiday on Monday 

Apple  AAPL  has left the iPhone X panic further and further in the dust 
NVIDIA Corporation  NASDAQ NVDA  NVDA is belatedly back on my buy the dip list  From a technical perspective  I should have bought the big 50DMA breakout on January 3rd  However  by the time I noticed the move  the stock was already well above its upper BB and provided a poor risk reward for a short term trade  NVDA continued to defy gravity from there  but in recent days it has pulled back ever so slightly from its upper BB  I am eyeing it like a hawk now  Like the great Caterpillar  NYSE CAT  trade  an ideal entry for NVDA will be a test of the lower bound of the upper BB channel   One could argue NVDA got  close enough  to such a test last week  

NVIDIA  NVDA  spent all of December broken down below its 50DMA  NVDA brought that bearish signal to a definitive end in 2018 with a powerful 50DMA breakout

"After a decent rally in equities last week  this week has on the docket several potentially market moving events   from FOMC meeting to mid term elections to China trade  Longs can think of selling some covered calls 
Last week  two separate US data points showed a slight pickup in employee wages  Wage growth has been a consistent disappointment throughout this recovery expansion  which is into its 10th year now 
Average hourly earnings of private employees in October rose 3 1 percent year over year to  27 30  This was the first time since April 2009 that this metric grew with a three handle  In the big scheme of things  wages are still suppressed  particularly considering how mature the expansion is and considering inflation is at near the Fed s two percent goal 
In the 12 months to September  core PCE  personal consumption expenditures    the Fed s favorite measure of consumer inflation   rose 1 97 percent  with growth of 2 03 percent in July  which was the first reading with a two handle since April 2012  Core CPI  consumer price index  has risen with a two handle since March this year 
That said  the y y trend has been up since bottoming in October 2012  Chart 1  
That is also the case with the employment cost index  Total compensation   comprised of wages and salaries plus benefits   for private industry workers bottomed at increase of 1 2 percent y y in 4Q09  In 3Q18  it grew 2 9 percent  This was the fastest pace since 2Q08  Chart 2  
This in all likelihood gives FOMC hawks more reason to maintain their bias  After three 25 basis point hikes this year  markets expect one more in December  18 19   with 79 percent odds in the futures market  Since December 2015  the fed funds rate has gone up by 200 basis points to a range of 200 to 225 basis points  Next year  the dot plot expects three more 25 basis point increases  Markets are not as hawkish  So whenever data like last Friday s come out  indigestion follows  Apart from the pickup in wages  non farm payroll went up 250 000 in October  In the first 10 months this year  the economy created a monthly average of 213 000 non farm jobs  In 2017  the monthly average was 182 000  versus 195 000 in 2016  226 000 in 2015 and 250 000 in 2014 
Last Friday  investors were already unnerved by Apple  NASDAQ AAPL  s rather underwhelming September quarter report and guidance  As a result  major US indices struggled  the Nasdaq 100 index in particular  It shed 1 5 percent in that session  In contrast  the S P 500 large cap index fell 0 6 percent  while the Russell 2000 small cap index rose 0 2 percent  The Nasdaq 100  6965 29   in fact  tried to rally intraday  but was rejected at the 200 day moving average  This preceded a decent rally post last Monday s intraday reversal at 6574 75  Chart 3  
In ideal circumstances  the Nasdaq 100 has room to rally  particularly on a weekly basis  But it also sustained quite a bit of damage during last month s rout  Rejected at the upper end of a nine month ascending channel in the beginning of the month  it went on to drop out of it toward the end  only to crawl back into it last week  Resistance is galore  Besides the 200 day  7300 lies right above  which already repelled rally attempts mid October  For now  gap up support lies at 6930  a loss of which raises the odds of more downside pressure 
A similar gap up support on the S P 500  2723 06   lies just north of 2700  Last Friday  it  too  just about tested the 200 day  Ideally  bulls would love to take out this average and go on to test 2800  which already resisted rally attempts on the 17th last month  Chart 4   This level also approximates the underside of a broken rising trend line from February 2016 
Failure to recapture the 200 day as soon as possible raises the odds of a retest of last week s lows  As is the case with the Nasdaq 100  weekly momentum indicators are oversold on the S P 500  Although in the very near term  things could go either way  Several daily momentum indicators have reached the median  which is as good a place as any for the index to turn back lower 
On the Russell 2000  1547 98   last Friday produced a spinning top  But the index last week outperformed by a wide margin  up 4 3 percent  versus up 2 4 percent for the S P 500 and up 1 7 percent for the Nasdaq 100  That said  small caps also fell the most during the selloff  From the all time high of August 31 to the low of October 26  the Russell 2000 collapsed 16 2 percent  For comparison purposes  the Nasdaq 100 between October 1 and 29 declined 14 6 percent  and the S P 500 between September 21 and October 29 dropped 11 5 percent 
In the last couple of weeks  16 month support at 1450 ish held on the Russell 2000  Chart 5   This follows loss of one after another support  including a rising trend line from February 2016 and major horizontal support at 1610 ish  Ideally  small cap bulls would like to go test that support turned resistance  The 200 day lies there as well  So does the underside of that broken trend line  Bulls need to defend support at just north of 1510 
Medium term  all these three indices have a long way to go before oversold conditions are unwound  Near term is another matter  This week has at least three potentially market moving events 
The FOMC begins a two day meeting Wednesday  They are not expected to move in this meeting  But markets will be on pins and needles as to what they might say about the recent uptick in wages  Come Tuesday  the mid term elections are held  And then the trade dispute with China  Chart 6   Last week  President Donald Trump was sounding optimistic about a possible deal with China  even as Larry Kudlow  National Economic Council director  was tamping down investor optimism  The issue of trade with China is not that simple  Just look at Chart 6  Year to September  China s surplus was north of  301 billion  Last year was  376 billion  One simply cannot waive a magic wand and cause the US deficit to drop  It is complicated  Markets hate uncertainty 
Given all this  stocks in general could go in either direction this week   perhaps perfect time to sell covered calls  Hypothetically on October 15  a short put was initiated on SPY  SPDR S P 500 ETF  NYSE SPY    which got put for an effective long at  271 22  It closed last Friday at  271 89  November 9th SPY 270 calls sell at  4 44  If called away  this ensures a profit of  3 22  Else  the price effectively drops to  266 78

In the past five trading days  telecom stocks witnessed a downtrend on President Trump s hint that there is no specific deadline for the ongoing  Phase One  deal between the United States and China  On cue  the market went on a tailspin  dragging the telecom sector down as uncertainty and unpredictability took centerstage  With China issuing strong protests for U S  legislations supporting Hong Kong protesters that reportedly meddled in so called  internal affairs   the outlook for the partial trade accord appeared murkier  However  the stocks showed some signs of a rebound in the later stages of the week as media reports confirmed that the deal was around the corner   As the clock ticks on the imposition of a fresh round of U S  tariffs on Dec 15 on  156 billion of imports from China  both sides are likely to seek an early resolution of the trade disputes on domestic compulsions  Although the optimism regarding the partial trade accord has been punctured with Trump hinting that the deal could spill off well in 2020  recent media reports have confirmed that the deal is to back on track   Meanwhile  the Trump administration is planning to utilize  60 billion funds earmarked for the U S  International Development Finance Corporation   DFC   to thwart China based telecom equipment manufacturers Huawei and ZTE  HK 0763   The move is the latest in a string of concerted efforts by the U S  government to dissuade other sovereign countries from using Huawei and ZTE gear to preempt alleged spying and siphoning of data  The United States has extensively used its diplomatic channels in the past to urge its allies to shun Huawei from their 5G wireless networks  citing security threat and espionage by China s government  The government now seeks to undertake a more proactive measure to fructify its ploy by possibly leveraging DFC tools to support purchases of non Chinese telecom gear by issuing credit to Huawei s European rivals  Industry grapevines further hint that DFC could also take minority equity stake in companies and offer loans  loan guarantees and political risk insurance Huawei has vehemently opposed the unilateral steps by the U S  authorities and has filed a lawsuit against the  unconstitutional  ruling to ban the use of federal subsidies by rural firms to buy its equipment  urging the court to overturn the order  The company is also reportedly mulling to shift its U S  operations to Canada against constant vigilantism and stiff opposition   Regarding company specific news  nationwide 5G launch  strategic collaboration

The Zacks  industry consists of manufacturers of specialty chemical products for a host of end use markets such as textile  paper  automotive  electronics  personal care  energy  construction and agriculture  These chemicals  including catalysts  surfactants  speciality polymers  coating additives  pesticides and oilfield chemicals  are used based on their performance and have a specific purpose  They have application in the manufacturing process of a vast range of products  including paints and coatings  cosmetics  petroleum products  inks  and plastics Here are the industry s three major themes Trade tariffs remain a drag on the chemical specialty industry  The United States and China had imposed billions of dollars in punitive tariffs on each others  products last year  China s tariffs on American products include a wide range of chemical products  including specialty chemicals  While recent talks between the countries have raised hopes of a possible resolution to the protracted trade dispute  the tariffs currently in place are already doing damage to the industry  China is among the most important trading partners of the American chemical industry and is one of the biggest export markets for U S  chemicals  Beijing s retaliatory tariffs are hurting U S  chemical exports  Moreover  trade friction has led to a slowdown in demand in the automotive market  a major specialty chemical end use market  in China  The trade tiff has also led to a slowdown in industrial activities across Asia and Europe  hurting demand for specialty chemicals  Companies in the chemical specialty space face headwinds from a spike in costs of raw materials as a result of short supply  The stricter environmental policy in China has led to tightening in the supply of certain key raw materials as a result of plant closures  The disruption in the supply chain has pushed up prices of inputs  Higher raw material prices are  thus  likely to squeeze margins of chemical specialty companies over the short haul  In a challenging environment  chemical specialty companies remain focused on strategic actions including cost cutting and productivity improvement  expansion into high growth markets  operational efficiency improvement  and expansion of scale through acquisitions  Moreover  a number of companies are taking aggressive price increase actions in the wake of raw material cost inflation  These actions are likely to help them alleviate any pressure on margin Zacks Industry Rank Indicates Bleak ProspectsThe Zacks Chemicals Specialty industry is part of the broader Zacks  sector  It carries a Zacks Industry Rank  232  which places it at the bottom 9  of more than 250 Zacks industries The group s   which is basically the average of the Zacks Rank of all the member stocks  indicates a gloomy near term  Our research shows that the top 50  of the Zacks ranked industries outperforms the bottom 50  by a factor of more than 2 to 1 The industry s position in the bottom 50  of the Zacks ranked industries is a result of negative earnings outlook for the constituent companies in aggregate  Looking at the aggregate earnings estimate revisions  it appears that analysts are pessimistic about this group s earnings growth potential  Over the past year  the industry s earnings estimate for the current year has gone down 14 6  Before we present a few specialty chemical stocks that you may want to consider for your portfolio  let s take a look at the industry s recent stock market performance and current valuation Industry Lags S P 500The Zacks Chemicals Specialty industry has lagged the Zacks S P 500 composite over the past year  The industry has gained 5 5  over this period compared with the S P 500 s rise of 10 5   Meanwhile  the broader Zacks Basic Materials Sector tumbled 9 5  over the past year One Year Price Performance Industry s Current ValuationOn the basis of trailing 12 month enterprise value to EBITDA  EV EBITDA  ratio  which is a commonly used multiple for valuing chemical stocks  the industry is currently trading at 22 22X  above the S P 500 s 10 94X and the sector s 8 81X Over the past five years  the industry has traded as high as 25 21X  as low as 16 83X  with a median of 22 32X  as the chart below shows Enterprise Value EBITDA  EV EBITDA  Ratio  Enterprise Value EBITDA  EV EBITDA  Ratio  Bottom LineChemical specialty companies are bearing the brunt of trade tariffs  Moreover  margins of these producers will remain under pressure over the near term in an inflationary environment given raw material supply constraints  Nevertheless  strategic actions including continued focus on cost and productivity  selling price hikes and earnings accretive acquisitions should keep them afloat in the near term None

"On Monday night  more than eighty million Americans watched our two candidates for president argue more about missing tax returns  deleted emails  and a former beauty queen than the issue that matters most to our country s health and prosperity  economic growth 
When our economy grows rapidly  as it did during the Reagan and  Bill  Clinton administrations  good things happen  Home ownership increases  budget deficits shrink  Mr  Clinton produced a surplus his last four years   crime drops  and America s influence increases worldwide  Unfortunately  our gross domestic product hasn t grown more than four percent a year since the end of the last century  and I don t see it topping that critical figure again anytime soon 
In both 2014 and 2015  US GDP expanded at a subpar 2 4 percent rate  The first half of 2016 was even more sluggish  GDP grew only one percent  While both George W  Bush and Barack Obama inherited messes when they came into office the terrorist attacks of 9 11 took place early in Bush s first term and Obama had to contend with the fallout of the 2008 2009 financial crisis each deserves a C   at best  for their economic oversight 
I fear Hillary Clinton or Donald Trump will do no better  Hillary wants to increase personal income taxes  increase regulation of our fossil fuel industry  and keep the US corporate tax rate at 35 percent  Meanwhile  Trump s anti immigration rhetoric immigrants  legal and illegal  start one third of new businesses and threatened trade wars could push our anemic economy into another recession  One wonders if Mr  Trump has ever read about  or even heard of  the ill fated 1930 Smoot Hawley tariff act and how it kick started the Great Depression  I doubt it 
Here are seven straightforward tax and policy proposals that many economists agree would stimulate economic growth 
1  Lower the US corporate tax rate from 35 percent to the worldwide average of 20 22 percent and adopt a  territorial tax  where offshore profits of US corporations are not  trued up  to the higher US rate when those profits are repatriated  This would all but stop the ongoing inversions of corporate headquarters abroad and induce companies to bring offshore profits back to America  All told  S P 500 companies now hold over  3 trillion in cash and earnings outside of the US  according to a recent  by Credit Suisse  SIX CSGN   Apple  NASDAQ AAPL  alone is sitting on more than  200 billion in offshore cash  Imagine how many jobs and opportunities even a portion of those enormous sums could create if our tax policy incentivized businesses to invest foreign earnings here at home 
2  Eliminate ALL income tax deductions  The US tax code was already a complicated mess almost forty years ago when President Jimmy Carter called it  a disgrace to the human race   It s far more complicated now  This leads to lower growth  ill advised investment decisions  and money wasted preparing and filing tax returns  Contrary to popular opinion  most deductions benefit the upper middle and upper class  The  big five  deductions are health insurance premiums  mortgage interest  state income taxes  charity donations  and retirement plans  Because every American already receives a standard deduction of  6300 for single taxpayers and  12 600 for married  these itemized deductions almost exclusively lower the tax obligations of the well off while depriving the US Treasury of roughly  400 billion annually  vs  our total budget of  4 trillion 
3  Reduce the number of tax brackets from today s seven to two or  at most  three  As importantly  the highest rate should be below 30 percent  Studies show that a higher top rate increases the likelihood taxpayers retire  cheat  or move away  While a single rate  flat tax  sounds appealing  it is not equitable and more importantly is not politically feasible  I believe those who make large amounts should pay a higher rate than those who earn little  But I also believe the lowest rate should apply to most wage earners  Everyone needs  skin in the game  
4  Adopt a balanced budget amendment  This would force politicians to stop  or at least slow  the explosion in our nation s current  19 trillion in debt  Someday  possibly soon  investors worldwide will stop buying US bonds at today s all time low interest rates  When if that occurs America s annual interest cost will double to over  1 trillion  This will  crowd out  other government spending  leading to a recession  Or worse 
5  Wind down Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac  These two quasi governmental agencies  which purchase and securitize mortgage debt  exacerbated the 2008 2009 housing crisis  They could do so again as lenders make questionable home loans knowing they can quickly sell them  and book profits  to Fannie and Freddie  In her recent book Shaky Ground  author Bethany McLean wrote that many observers  including President Obama and former Fed chief Paul Volcker  support closing these entities  While this would increase mortgage rates from   percent to possibly one percent  it would stop the risk Fannie and Freddie pose to America s taxpayers 
6  Fix Social Security and Medicare  Without changes  Social Security will deplete its current surplus within 20 years  Government economists believe recipients will receive  at most  70 percent of promised benefits when that occurs  There are only three options to avoid this  reduce benefits  increase payroll taxes  or do a little of both  A start would be to  means test  benefits  reduce cost of living increases  and lift the amount at which payroll taxes are collected  Fixing Medicare is more complicated  but we have to allow Medicare Medicaid programs which buy about half of all health services to negotiate directly with pharmaceutical companies  medical device manufacturers  and other health care providers 
7  Offer Medicare to all American taxpayers  The current Obamacare hybrid is destroying jobs because it forces corporations to pay health care premiums for a growing percentage of their employees  Many have responded by hiring fewer folks  If a government health plan was available to all Americans  and everyone with income above a nominal amount could buy that plan  another plan  or pay a substantial penalty   corporations could shed the burden of providing health benefits and focus on what they do best 
From a nonpartisan perspective  these seven proposals are all strongly pro growth  no brainer reforms  Several of them were included in the Bowles Simpson tax plan a few years ago  And yet  because the plan threatened many of the special interest groups that own our political process  both President Obama and congressional Republicans refused to embrace it  Voters  and taxpayers  deserve better "

Commentary
As I like to say  it is HARD being bearish on the market when Apple  Inc  NASDAQ AAPL  is trading bullishly 

Apple  Inc   AAPL  achieves a fresh all time high  finally invalidating all previous bearish signals
AAPL became the first company ever to surpass  700B in value yesterday  The chart above shows that AAPL has now invalidated the previous bearish chart signals that worried me  The perfect bounce off the first Bollinger  Band  BB  opens up the strong potential for a fresh run up  The Apple Trading Model  ATM  predicted the opposite direction for the day unfortunately  So  I will be playing some catch up assuming AAPL does indeed launch into a fresh uptrend 
My trading bias remains bearish on the overall market because the rally for the S P 500 ETF  ARCA SPY  failed to break the top of the trading range yesterday 

The S P 500 launches back into the top of its trading range
 and T2108 barely managed to eke out a gain after spending most of the day in negative territory 

Although the S P 500 was up for the entire day  T2108 was negative most of the day  It only closed with a slight gain thanks to an intraday rally 
This divergence implies that yesterday s rally was led by a small group of stocks  Bulls and buyers still have a lot to prove beyond putting AAPL firmly back into bullish territory 
The volatility index  VIX  is still hanging tough as it pivots around its 50DMA  It is still in position to launch off approximate support at any time 

The VIX is still pivoting around its 50DMA
All this means it makes plenty of sense to press my bet on my favorite hedge on bullishness  Caterpillar  NYSE CAT   I doubled down on my March puts yesterday  right after trading opened for the day 

Caterpillar  Inc   CAT  has already filled its post earnings gap down but failed to make further progress yesterday
While we wait to see whether the market can finally break out or whether we will need to endure yet more chop  here are some charts of interest  These are all bullish and will be even MORE interesting once if the market finally breaks out and launches an extended overbought rally 
Conn s Conn s Inc  NASDAQ CONN  has amazingly gained another 20  since I sold my call options  I of course wish I had been more patient but suffering through that fade in December on the previous CONN trade really made me extra eager to lock in profits this time around 

Conn s Inc   CONN  has continued its post earnings surge  now including a bullish 50DMA breakout and a fresh post December earnings high
Tableau Software  In my last T2108 Update  I discussed the pre earnings trade set up in Splunk  NASDAQ SPLK  after it gapped up in sympathy with bullish earnings from Tableau Software  NYSE DATA   SPLK has now sold off the last two days back to its 50DMA  It suddenly occurred to me to check on DATA and  sure enough  the stock was also pulling back from its post earnings gains  I did not hesitate to make a bullish bet with call options as DATA neared its first Bollinger  Band 
So far  so good  as DATA smartly bounced off support  I am looking for DATA to resume its upward momentum past its post earnings high 

Tableau Software  DATA  pulled back to the first Bollinger Band  BB  before resuming post earnings momentum

A rough road  but a general uptrend from last year s low
FireEye Fireeye Inc  NASDAQ FEYE  will be reporting earnings Wednesday evening  I will be watching closely as the chart below shows the stock has been trending upward into a potential breakout 

FireEye  FEYE  is slowing trending up from recent low into a potential bullish breakout
I just discussed a change in my oil related trades that involved locking in profits in call options on Linn Energy  NASDAQ LINE   It was well timed precaution as LINE smartly pulled back from resistance  Near the close  I decided to use some of those profits to buy back a few March call options 
I do not plan on expanding the position although I might consider a new one if LINE crumbles all the way back to  10 or so  depending on the dynamics in the oil market at that time of course  

Linn Energy  LINE  falls back from resistance   this rejection is not nearly as violent as the last one 
First Solar First Solar  NASDAQ FSLR  continued a theme on the day of smart bounces off support and lows  I doubled down on FSLR call options as it approached its 50DMA support  This is part of my new hedged trade on solar stocks  a separate piece still to come on this    Going into the close  FSLR rallied smartly on news that  on an  850M solar farm  This news should work wonders for sentiment in solar stocks which have slumped in parallel with energy and commodities  Now it looks like the latest bounce in late January might actually hold 

First Solar  FSLR  stages a big comeback off 50DMA support thanks to news about a partnership with Apple  AAPL 
So  overall  there are PLENTY of reasons to get constructive on the market again  but I still want to see the S P 500 and T2108 partner up to prove the bullishness 
Daily T2108 vs the S P 500
Black line  T2108  measured on the right   Green line  S P 500  for comparative purposes Red line  T2108 Overbought  70    Blue line  T2108 Oversold  20

"JPMorgan s   NYSE JPM   trading revenues in the fourth quarter are likely to be positively impacted by substantial volatility  which drove its performance in the first three quarters of the year as well  As trading revenues constitute almost one fifth of the bank s top line  this is expected to support its results scheduled to be announced on Jan 15 During the fourth quarter  several developments   including further escalation of U S  China trade war  Brexit related uncertainty  fears of global economic slowdown  changing yield curve and the Federal Reserve s stance related to interest rate hikes   rocked the markets and kept the trading desks busy  So  this incited substantial volatility and resulted in a rise in client activity Further  at an investors  conference in early December 2018  JPMorgan s CEO Jamie Dimon projected trading revenues to be flat year over year in the to be reported quarter Like the prior quarters  equity trading is mainly expected to support trading revenues  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for equity trading revenues of  1 42 billion reflects a jump of 23 7  from the prior year quarter  Further  per the consensus estimate  fixed income trading revenues will likely be down 5 1  year over year to  2 11 billion Apart from this  here are some of the other primary factors that will likely influence JPMorgan s fourth quarter results Modest net interest income growth  A slight improvement in lending scenario   mainly in the areas of commercial and industrial  C I   commercial real estate and consumer   will likely lead to an increase in net interest income  NII   A rise in interest rates will offer some support despite flattening of the yield curve and steadily increasing deposit betas in the fourth quarter Also  the Zacks Consensus Estimate for average interest earning assets of  2 23 trillion for the fourth quarter indicates a 2  year over year increase  This  along with modest lending activities  is projected to boost the company s NII in the to be reported quarter For 2018  management expects NII to be roughly  55 5 billion  up from  50 billion in 2017   benefiting from loan growth and higher rates  Further  average core loan growth  excluding CIB loans  is expected to be in the range of 6 7   Also  management projects C I loans to grow in the mid single digit rates Disappointing investment banking performance  Seasonality hurt investment banking revenues in the fourth quarter  Fears of global economic slowdown and increased volatility weighed on companies  plans to raise capital by issuing shares  Nonetheless  JPMorgan s top position in the market is expected to provide some respite  which may result in a slight increase in equity underwriting fees Further  rise in interest rates is likely to have slowed down companies  involvement in debt issuance activities  As debt origination fees account for about half of total investment banking fees for JPMorgan  this is expected to have an adverse impact on investment banking revenues to some extent Additionally  decline in global M A deals in the fourth quarter will likely hurt the company s advisory fees to an extent  Volatile markets and increase in borrowing costs are some of the key reasons that hampered deal making activities  Nevertheless  JPMorgan s top position in garnering global investment banking fees  and the strong M A deal pipeline over the prior quarters are likely provide the bank some leverage Notably  the consensus estimate for total banking revenues  of which investment banking revenues constitutes a major portion  of  3 04 billion indicates a marginal fall from the prior year quarter Slowdown in mortgage banking  With the refinance boom almost ending and interest rates rising  a big help is not expected from this segment  Further  home equity loan portfolio is likely to decline in the to be reported quarter  As JPMorgan hasn t bulked up its mortgage banking businesses since the last recession  it is expected to witness muted growth in the same Lesser scope of cost containment  As the majority of unnecessary expenses have already been cut by the bank  expense reduction will not likely be a major support  As JPMorgan s plan to enter newer markets by opening branches is already a work in progress  operating expenses are likely to remain on the higher side  Also  increased investment in technology to strengthen digital offerings will result in a rise in costs Management expects adjusted operating expenses to be nearly  63 5 billion in 2018 Here is what our quantitative model predicts The chances of JPMorgan beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate this time are high as it has the right combination of two key ingredients   a positive  and Zacks Rank  3  Hold  or higher You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they re reported with our  Earnings ESP  The Earnings ESP for JPMorgan is  0 03  Zacks Rank  JPMorgan carries a Zacks Rank  3  which increases the

    The Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings of  2 19 reflects 23 9  growth on a year over year basis  Further  the consensus estimate for sales of  26 7 billion shows 10 4  increase from the prior year quarter Other Stocks That Warrant a LookHere are a few other major bank stocks that you may want to consider  as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements for an earnings beat this time around U S  Bancorp   NYSE USB   is scheduled to release results on Jan 16  The company  which carries a Zacks Rank of 3  has an Earnings ESP of  0 15  M T Bank Corporation   NYSE MTB   is scheduled to release results on Jan 17  It has an Earnings ESP of  1 03  and a Zacks Rank  3  You can see  The Earnings ESP for BB T Corporation   NYSE BBT   is  0 64  and it carries a Zacks Rank of 3  The company is scheduled to report quarterly numbers on Jan 17 More Stock News  This Is Bigger than the iPhone It could become the mother of all technological revolutions  Apple  NASDAQ AAPL  sold a mere 1 billion iPhones in 10 years but a new breakthrough is expected to generate more than 27 billion devices in just 3 years  creating a  1 7 trillion market Zacks has just released a Special Report that spotlights this fast emerging phenomenon and 6 tickers for taking advantage of it  If you don t buy now  you may kick yourself in 2020 "

As of Nov 2  364 S P 500 members  representing 72 6  of the index s total market capitalization  have already reported their third quarter results While total earnings for these companies are up 1 6  on a year over year basis  72 3  of the companies beat EPS estimates   total revenue is up1 6  on a year over year basis  54 7  of the companies beat top line estimates  Notably  after five consecutive quarters of decline  earnings are finally back in the positive territory  However  with every passing day  positive surprises on the revenue front are becoming rarer to find As per our latest  report  overall third quarter earnings for S P 500 companies are anticipated to be up 2 4   compared to an earlier estimate of a rise of 2 1   from the year ago quarter on revenues that are estimated to increase 1 4  Growth is expected to be driven by solid results from the finance sector  However  finance s impressive show is anticipated to be mitigated by sluggish growth from the energy  autos  transportation and technology sectors Coming to the technology sector  74  of the index members have reported their quarterly results with total earnings increasing 1  on 1 4  higher revenues  Notably  84 2  of the companies have surpassed earnings per share estimates  while 71 1  have beaten revenue estimates  However  technology earnings growth is expected to remain muted due to disappointing results from Apple   NASDAQ AAPL    Although the iPhone maker beat fourth quarter 2016 earnings estimates by a penny  its earnings declined 15  on a year over year basis on 9 9  decline in revenues Semiconductors comprise an important component of the technology sector and are anticipated to remain on the earnings growth trajectory in the quarter Here we take a look at four semiconductor companies that are set to report earnings on Nov 7 Microchip Technology Inc    NASDAQ MCHP   is unlikely to beat second quarter fiscal 2017 earnings estimates as it has an unfavorable combination of a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  and an  of 0 00   Please check our  that enables you to find stocks that are expected to come out with earnings surprises This is because  as per our proven model  a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3 to beat earnings  We caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank  4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  going into an earnings announcement  especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions Microchip Technology develops and manufactures specialized semiconductor products used by its customers for a wide variety of embedded control applications During the quarter  the company released the industry s first end to end security solution for Internet of Things  IoT  devices that are compatible with Amazon  NASDAQ AMZN  Web Services  The company also rolled out its MOST50 networking devices for infotainment devices and introduced a new development board specifically meant for carrying out designing tasks on both 16 bit and 32 bit microcontrollers While these developments augur well for the company  an uncertain macroeconomic environment  foreign currency risk  and competition can adversely affect its earnings in the to be reported quarter  MICROCHIP TECH Price and EPS Surprise   We note that Microchip Technology s results compared favorably with the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three out of the last four quarters  resulting in an average positive surprise of 5 32  ON Semiconductor Corp    NASDAQ ON   too is unlikely to beat third quarter 2016 earnings estimates as it has an unfavorable combination of an Earnings ESP of 0 00  and a Zacks Rank  2 ON Semiconductor is a supplier of broadband and power management integrated circuits and standard semiconductors used in numerous advanced devices  Its products range from high speed fiber optic networking equipment to precise power management functions found in portable electronics Notably  ON Semiconductor acquired Fairchild Semiconductor for  2 4 billion of cash in September  which is likely to bolster the company s product line of power management and analog semiconductor solutions  The company introduced many new products during the quarter such as the next generation fan motor driver for facilitating simplicity in appliance design  low light industrial imaging solutions and an intelligent charge controller chip for power banks among others which place the company in good stead However  a significant debt burden and fierce competition in the semiconductor space remain concerns ahead of the third quarter earnings release ON SEMICON CORP Price and EPS Surprise   Notably  ON Semiconductor s results have beaten the Zacks Consensus Estimate in two of the preceding four quarters with an average positive surprise of 4 58  Similarly  MaxLinear  Inc    NYSE MXL   is also unlikely to beat third quarter 2016 earnings estimates as it has an unfavorable combination of a Zacks Rank  2 and an Earnings ESP of 0 00  MaxLinear is a provider of radio frequency analog and mixed signal semiconductor SoC solutions for broadband communication applications offering small silicon die size  and low power consumption During the last quarter  the company achieved the 1 million milestone for shipments of digital satellite outdoor units to Microelectronics Technology  The company also jointly developed a set top box reference design along with MStar Semiconductor for ultra high definition satellite broadcast TV While these developments augur well for the company  foreign currency risk and interest rate risk remain concerns MAXLINEAR INC A Price and EPS Surprise   Notably  MaxLinear s results have beaten the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three out of the preceding four quarters with an average positive surprise of 5 32  On the other hand  the odds are in favor of Vishay Intertechnology Inc    NYSE VSH    It is expected to beat third quarter 2016 earnings estimates as it has a favorable combination of an Earnings ESP of  4 00  and a Zacks Rank  1  You can see  Vishay is a leading international manufacturer and supplier of discrete passive electronic components and discrete active electronic components  particularly resistors  capacitors  inductors  diodes and transistors Notably  during the last quarter  Vishay introduced the 4 line diode that enables extreme size reduction for portable electronics  Additionally  the company ramped up its optoelectronics portfolio with the introduction of two new product lines of miniature infrared receiver modules  which have applications in remote controls of consumer appliances VISHAY INTERTEC Price and EPS Surprise   Vishay s results have beaten the Zacks Consensus Estimate in two out of the preceding four quarters with

The Zacks Research Daily presents the best research output of our analyst team  Today s Research Daily features new research reports on 16 major stocks  including Apple  AAPL   Pfizer  NYSE PFE   PFE  and Carnival  LON CCL   CCL  These research reports have been hand picked from the roughly 70 reports published by our analyst team today 
You can see 
Apple s shares are up  39 5  in the year to date period  handily outperforming the S P 500  up  13 3   and the Zacks Technology sector  up  20 7    The Zacks analyst thinks Apple s enriched product portfolio that now includes the new iPhones  Watch 3 and 4K TV will help the stock sustain momentum against S P 500 going forward  This  along with the company s  1 billion investment for acquiring original content and its plan to break into film distribution market will further boost services  revenues 
Additionally  foray into fast growing technologies like AI   AR VR are long term growth catalysts  However  the new iPhone X at  999 is quite pricey  particularly for markets like China and India  Moreover  slight delay in launching the product as compared with iPhone 8 and 8 Plus  reflects supply chain issues  This can be a concern during the upcoming holiday season  Moreover  intensifying competition from cheaper Chinese handset makers cannot be ignored

Shares of Pfizer have underperformed the peer group as well as the broader market year to date  the stock is up  12 1  over this period vs  a  19 3  increase for the Zacks Large Cap Pharmaceuticals industry and the  13 4  gain for the S P 500 index   Pfizer has been working on strengthening its product portfolio through acquisitions and licensing deals  However  Pfizer continues to face headwinds in the form of genericization of key drugs  lost alliance revenues  pricing pressure and rising competition which is hurting the top line 
Though Pfizer s growing immuno oncology portfolio offers strong potential  many of these assets are in early stage of development  Nonetheless  new products like Ibrance  contribution from acquisitions  cost cutting efforts and share buybacks should help the company achieve its guidance  Pfizer also boasts a strong pipeline and expects approximately 25 to 30 drug approvals over the next five years  including around 15 products that have blockbuster potential 
 You can  
Carnival s shares have outpaced the Zacks Leisure and Recreation Services industry in the past year  gaining  51  vs   38 6   The Zacks analyst likes the addition of new ships to its fleet given burgeoning demand for cruise travel in 2017  Additionally  Carnival is well positioned for continued earnings growth  given the current strength in its bookings along with pricing trends for the year 
Notably  its brand building efforts together with other marketing activities are driving bookings  Its strategy of growing beyond familiar itineraries and capitalizing on fast growing markets is likely to further drive growth  Meanwhile  estimates have been stable lately ahead of its fiscal third quarter earnings release and the company has positive record of earnings surprises in recent quarters 
However  adverse forex translations  higher costs along with macroeconomic issues in key operating regions remain headwinds  A potential increase in fuel costs can also hamper its profitability   You can

" Tuesday Market Open  It seems that investors are breathing a sigh of relief after getting some closure on big issues last week  perhaps setting Wall Street up for smooth sailing into the holiday break  That would be a welcome difference from last year  when stocks had a pre Christmas meltdown 
Investors appear to still be digesting welcome news that the U S  and China have reached a preliminary trade deal  That s good news with an asterisk as the phase one deal has yet to be signed  But U S  and Chinese officials could finalize the pact next month  Optimism about the deal is helping crude oil this morning as a stronger global economy could help boost demand  U S  crude recently pushed above  60 per barrel  While it might be a little premature to call it an upside breakout  the crude rally is certainly something to keep an eye on  
The market also appears more relaxed after a decisive election in Britain removed some uncertainty about Brexit  Closer to home  the Federal Reserve stood pat on interest rates  as expected  and indicated the bar would be pretty high on its next move 
In corporate news  Bed Bath   Beyond  NASDAQ BBBY  said six senior executives are leaving or have left the company  The move comes after the stock has struggled this year but has regained some ground in recent days  Still  sometimes cleaning the house can be a good thing  
Chinese Economic Data Puts Icing On The Cake
Good news related to China kept on coming Monday  As investors continued to be optimistic after last week s news that the U S  and China had agreed to a phase one trade deal  fresh economic data from the world s second largest economy added icing on the cake  Industrial production and retail sales numbers from the Asian nation came in better than expected  helping to ease some concerns about China s economy even as the interim trade deal seems like it could pave the way for increased growth there 
Now that the U S  is scaling back some already imposed tariffs and nixing the extra ones that were scheduled to come online earlier this month  the Chinese economy could get a boost going forward  Also  with the Dec  15 tariffs that targeted consumer goods including Apple s  NASDAQ AAPL  iPhone not materializing  it could mean the U S  consumer won t have to face higher prices for those goods if retailers had decided to pass along tariff related costs  The first round trade deal also marks a de escalation between the world s two largest economies  Still  there are issues to work out if another phase trade deal is to be signed  And  we have to remember that this interim deal isn t expected to be signed until January  
Consumers In FocusStill  the cancellation of the Dec  15 round of tariffs offers another shot in the arm for U S  consumers who have also been helped by low interest rates and a strong jobs market  
Later this week  the market is scheduled to get a peek into two companies that have their fingers on the pulse of consumers when Nike  NYSE NKE  and FedEx  NYSE FDX  report earnings  
As NKE ramps up direct to consumer sales and sees its online sales post gains  the company is taking advantage of the new economy which is less reliant on traditional brick and mortar stores where FDX also plays a huge role  And as more consumers have more money in their pockets with the strong jobs market  it stands to reason that these two companies would be among those doing well  
Also later this week  the market is scheduled to get a fresh reading on the Fed s preferred inflation gauge  in the form of the core PCE price index  which is expected to show a rise of 0 2  in November  according to a Briefing com consensus 
Recent core CPI data show inflation at 2 1  on an annual basis  and the most recent core PCE price index showed an annual rise of 1 6   With the jobs market so tight and economic indicators generally sound  it could be interesting to see whether this week s PCE number gets the yearly figure closer to the Fed s 2  target  







FIGURE 1  LOSING ALTITUDE  Yesterday  the Dow Jones Industrial Average  DJI   candlesticks  didn t perform as well as other stock indices such as the broad based S P 500 Index  SPX   purple line   A nearly 4 3  drop in Boeing  NYSE BA   which has the largest percentage weight in the 30 stock  DJI  helped cap its gains  BA shares were under pressure after The Wall Street Journal reported the jet maker was considering halting or further cutting production of its 737 MAX amid uncertainty over the planes  return to service  The company late Monday confirmed it would suspend production  pushing its shares down another 1 3  in premarket trading this morning  Data source  S P Dow Jones Indices  Chart source  The thinkorswim  platform from TD Ameritrade  For illustrative purposes only  Past performance does not guarantee future results  
Healthy Housing  There have been lots of winners during the 2019 trading year  and the housing market participated  A strong jobs market and low interest rates have helped boost the PHLX Housing Sector Index  HGX  around 45  year to date through Monday s close  When people are confident in their employment  they re often more willing to shell out for big purchases such as a home  And when mortgage rates are lower  that can often entice buyers  
Strong NAHB Index  The latest numbers from the National Association of Home Builders Wells Fargo Housing Market Index were out Monday and also painted a picture of a strong home building industry  Builder confidence in the market for newly built single family homes rose five points to 76 in December  marking the highest reading since June 1999  And November s figure was upwardly revised   Builders are continuing to see the housing rebound that began in the spring  supported by a low supply of existing homes  low mortgage rates  and a strong labor market   according to NAHB Chairman Greg Ugalde 
More Housing Data This Week This morning  numbers on housing starts and building permits for November came in better than expected  adding to the narrative that the housing market is doing well  We ll get another couple of looks at the housing market later this week when mortgage applications  data and then existing home sales numbers come out

"Data from the U S caused a strong rally for the dollar against most major currencies on Tuesday  as U S  building permits and housing starts exceeded analyst expectations  The U S  Commerce Department reported that the number of building permits issued last month increased by 10 1  when analysts expected a 2 2  increase  In addition  U S  housing starts announced a 20 2  increase in April far past expectations for an increase of 9 9   In the European front the ZEW Centre for Economic Research reported that German economic sentiment fell to 41 9  the lowest level since December and far below expectations of a 49 0 reading  Elsewhere  the Reserve Bank of Australia held the minutes of its May policy meeting where it announced that it is open to further rate cuts  due to the slowdown in China s economy and worries regarding the jobs sector  Investors  will be watching closely on the Fed minutes later in the day as they look for clues on the future monetary policy of the Fed  
EUR USD 
The euro posted a sharp drop against the dollar for a second consecutive day  after Senior ECB policymaker Benoit Coeure said the bank is planning to speed up the pace of its bond buying stimulus program before the summer in order to avoid the  notably lower market liquidity  in late July and August  In addition  solid building permits and housing starts data from the U S combined with a weak reading of the German ZEW economic sentiment index caused the EUR USD pair to drop by more than 1   to trade below the 1 12 level  Investors  attention today will be shifted towards the Fed minutes as the market awaits for clues on the future monetary policy of the Fed

 In Feb  28 story  corrects to   22 6 billion  from   22 5 billion  and to  177 million  from  178 billion  in paragraph 28  By Stephen Nellis and Nivedita Bhattacharjee  Reuters    Music streaming service Spotify on Wednesday filed for a direct listing of its shares  laying out financial data for the first time that cheered some analysts but led others to question how it could turn a profit from its growing subscriber base  Spotify  which wants to trade as SPOT on the New York Stock Exchange  is taking an unusual path to the U S  public markets  with a direct listing that will let investors and employees sell shares without the company raising new capital or hiring a Wall Street bank or broker to underwrite the offering   Because the company will not issue any new shares  it did not specify a listing price  Based on private transactions  it is valued at roughly  19 billion  according to Reuters calculations  Spotify  launched in 2008 and available in more than 60 countries  is the biggest music streaming company in the world and counts services from Apple Inc  O AAPL   Amazon com Inc  O AMZN  and Alphabet Inc s  O GOOGL  Google as its main rivals  RISING SALES  COSTS IN CHECK In the filing  Spotify laid out detailed financial data for the first time  showing rising revenue and relatively steady operating costs  which analysts took as a positive  Revenue rose 39 percent to 4 09 billion euros   4 99 billion  in 2017  from 2 95 billion euros a year earlier  Its operating loss widened to 378 million euros in 2017 from 349 million euros  Its net loss ballooned 129 percent in 2017  driven mostly by financing costs related to a 2016 deal in which Sweden based Spotify raised  1 billion in debt that would convert to shares upon an initial public offering   The revenue continues to grow but in particular their costs are growing slower than revenue  which is exactly what you expect in a business like this   said Jay Ritter  an expert in initial public offerings and professor at the University of Florida  Spotify compared its aspirations to the reach of Facebook  O FB  and YouTube   We believe the universality of music gives us the opportunity to reach many of the over 3 6 billion internet users globally   it said  With 71 million premium subscribers globally  Spotify has about twice as many paying customers as music streaming runner up Apple  with 36 million  Including those who listen to advertising supported streams  Spotify has about 159 million monthly average users   Amazon Music Unlimited has 16 million paying subscribers  and  Pandora Media  Inc  N P  has 5 48 million total subscribers  Google has not said how many subscribers it has to Google Play  its music streaming service  Spotify s premium subscription costs  9 99 a month  but it said it saw great potential in its ad supported service  which Apple does not offer   With our ad supported service  we believe there is a large opportunity to grow users and gain market share from traditional terrestrial radio   Spotify said  The net proportion of subscribers who left Spotify s paid for service  or churn  fell to 5 1 percent of paying customers at the end of 2017  from 6 9 percent at the start of 2016  the company said   This has been a question we ve been wondering for a long time  how sustainable is Spotify s model  This is the very first time we re seeing public disclosure about churn  and the news there is really good   said Larry Miller  head of the music business program at New York University s Steinhardt School  Spotify calculated that customers brought in 3 6 times more revenue over their life as a user than the company spent on marketing to attract them  as of the end of 2017  helping boost free cash flow to 109 million euros by the end of last year  Still  in going head to head against Apple  Amazon and others  Spotify is  competing against companies that never need to make a dime on music as a standalone business and that in fact use it to drive other aspects of their business   Miller said   Apple and Alphabet also control the two main operating systems used by smartphones  iOS and Android  They and Amazon are all developing computer assistants  such as Amazon s Alexa and Apple s Siri  that could give the bigger companies advantages   Many of our competitors enjoy competitive advantages such as greater name recognition  legacy operating histories  and larger marketing budgets  as well as greater financial  technical  human  and other resources   Spotify said in its filing  Apple has launched massive marketing campaigns around its service and added subscribers rapidly in the last three years   I don t think there s any doubt that the pace of competition this year has quickened   Miller said  Spotify has a powerful ally  in the music arm of China s Tencent Holdings Ltd  HK 0700   The companies in December said they would buy minority stakes in each other  helping increase exposure to each other s core markets  STOCK COULD BE VOLATILE A direct listing does not dilute ownership  as would happen with a conventional initial public offering  and saves hundreds of millions of dollars in underwriting fees  But it also frees existing owners from any lockup period restricting them from selling their shares following the listing   Underwriters that provide price stability for new listings are not used in a direct listing  which could mean a volatile start for Spotify shares in public  Shares trade privately in a wide band  Spotify is valued between  16 8 billion and  22 6 billion  based on recent ordinary share prices between  95 and  127 50 in the private markets in February and 177 million shares estimated outstanding by the end of February  according to its filing  Synovus Trust portfolio manager Dan Morgan described Spotify as  interesting   but questioned how quickly it might become profitable   How can Spotify monetize its user base beyond a  5  15 monthly subscription fee    Morgan asked

	Chicago  IL   April 18  2017   Zacks com announces the list of stocks featured in the Analyst Blog  Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets  Stocks recently featured in the blog include Broadcom  NASDAQ AVGO   NASDAQ           Western Digital  NASDAQ           Apple  NASDAQ           Alphabet  NASDAQ GOOGL   NASDAQ          and Amazon  NASDAQ          

	Today  Zacks is promoting its   Buy   stock recommendations     

Here are highlights from Monday s Analyst Blog  

Why Suitors Are Flocking to Toshiba s Chip Business 

	Toshiba has been in trouble since the surfacing of accounting irregularities in its Westinghouse nuclear business that included cost overruns on nuclear construction projects as well as overstatement of profit from the years 2008 through 2014  The company expects to report an annual loss of  9 billion this year due to write downs related to Westinghouse and has given a warning that it may not be able to continue as a going concern as a result  This ultimately also led to tensions with auditors PriceWaterhouseCoopers 

	But not all of this 142 year old electronics conglomerate is mired in losses  one section that is doing rather well is the flash memory chip business  where it has a JV with SanDisk  now Western Digital   So Toshiba needs to sell this business and install proper internal controls  which if unsatisfactory  will lead to its de listing  Which is why it has put this business on auction 

	While the front runners in the bidding process are Broadcom  NASDAQ          and private equity firm Silver Lake Partners  Taiwan s Foxconn  Honhai Precision Industry   South Korean chipmaker SK Hynix  and Western Digital  NASDAQ         itself  some news reports indicate that Softbank  Apple  NASDAQ           Alphabet  NASDAQ          and Amazon  NASDAQ          may also be interested 

	Of these  Broadcom s first round offer of 2 5 trillion yen   23 billion  and Foxconn s 2 trillion yen are the highest bids  Hynix s bid is unknown as is Western Digital s  but WDC has said that analysts estimate the fair value to be around 1 5 trillion yen 

Why the Excitement 

	Toshiba is the second largest NAND flash memory maker  a technology that is increasingly taking over mobile devices and finding application in the cloud  The advantage of flash memory is in its speed and reliability  while the regular hard drive storage is cheaper but shorter lived  As the cost of flash drives falls over time  it will be used more broadly and will replace or at least supplement hard drive storage 

	Since most tech players mentioned in the previous section either sell memory or buy it  they would gain leverage from acquiring the technology  Those that sell can augment their current offerings while those that buy will have another way to consolidate their supply chain and thus lower costs while also gaining technological advantage 

What Could Be the Result

	The deal will have a political angle to it  since the Japanese government is unlikely to approve a sale to investors that might bring risk to national security  Because of its links to China  a sale to Foxconn will likely not be approved by the government  even if Japanese banks agree to partner with it to finance the deal  So Hynix is better placed to win 

	On the other hand  the government will be quicker to approve the deal if the unit stays between Japanese and American owners  Since Western Digital has issues with Broadcom  and it will most likely have a say  given its  13 billion investment in the JV over several years and current agreement with Toshiba   Broadcom may not be able to bid successfully in this case  But Western Digital won t be able to buy out the unit unless it gets itself some partners  the company may not be able to dish out more cash so soon after SanDisk  

	That leaves combinations of American and Japanese players  which may include Apple and Softbank  Apple will prefer that Foxconn gets a stake because it is its major supplier  So Toshiba may successfully sell a portion of the business to the Apple Foxconn combination or Apple Softbank Foxconn combination or a combination that includes Softbank and other players

Thursday was an exceptionally active day in the foreign exchange market with many major currency pairs unwinding Wednesday s moves  A confluence of factors turned risk on to risk off and breakouts into fake outs  The sell off began in Asia after the People s Bank of China Governor Zhou warned about excessive optimism  It exacerbated after the unexpected election decision in New Zealand and then carried over into Europe and North America when Spain took steps to suspend Catalonia s autonomy  Reports in a Taiwan newspaper that Apple  NASDAQ AAPL  cut its orders for iPhone 8 also added pressure to asset prices  causing U S  bond yields to fall and U S  equities to open sharply lower  All of these factors  combined with the day s 30 year anniversary of the Black Monday crash of 1987  caused big moves in currencies  We ll discuss some of these in further detail later but here s the summary

New Zealand s new coalition government was hands down the biggest story of the day   The decision by New Zealand First leader Winston Peters to shun the popular vote and form a coalition government with the Labour party s Jacinda Arden caught the market mis positioned  While this may be another example of politicians disregarding the majority popular vote  more importantly  the fact that Arden gained enough votes to stay in the race and move on to become New Zealand s youngest ever female Prime Minister is a testament to the world s desire for change  Peters chose to form a coalition with Labour because of their ability to advance their economic priorities such as immigration  foreign land buyers and reducing poverty  His decision is summed up best with the comment   We ve had to make a choice  whether it was with either National or Labour  for a modified status quo  or for change   With major policy differences between Labour and National  change is definitely in store  There will be major investments in the housing market with 100k affordable houses built and sold over the next 10 years  the RBNZ will add an employment mandate similar to the Fed  immigration will be cut back and the government will renegotiate elements of the Trans Pacific Partnership to increase restrictions on foreign home purchases  All of these steps are aimed at bolstering an economy that the new government sees as underperforming  For the RBNZ  an employment target could mean a longer period of easier policy  So while NZD USD just experienced its largest one day slide since August 24  2015   the day of the flash crash in U S  equities   it s a sell on rallies for an eventual move down to 68 cents   The U S  dollar shrugged off stronger than expected U S  data and instead took its cue from yields   Although U S  rates were down for most of the North American session  led by reports that Apple cut its iPhone 8 orders  they bounced off their lows by the end of the day and the same intraday reversal can be seen in stocks  Ahead of the 30 year anniversary of the Black Monday stock market crash  investors were nervous as their anxiety heightened by political developments abroad  However at the end of the day  U S  data is improving  Jobless claims dropped to its lowest level in more than 4 decades  hinting of a strong nonfarm payrolls report next month  The Philadelphia Fed manufacturing index also rebounded to 27 9 from 23 8  Economists had been looking for slower growth but the sharp rise in the Empire State survey suggests otherwise  Fed Chair Yellen speaks on Friday but not until markets close  so most of the day will be spent guessing whether she ll be hawkish or dovish  Chances are  there will be limited new position taking ahead of her lecture on monetary policy since the financial crisis   The Australian dollar  on the other hand  was the main beneficiary of NZD outflows   Not only was AUD one of the few currencies to outperform the greenback but it also hit a 17 month high versus the New Zealand dollar  The labor market continues to be one of the country s primary areas of strength   Australia added another 19 8K jobs in September with steady growth in full  and part time work  This helped push the unemployment rate back down to 5 5   the lowest level in more than 3 years  Although the PBoC warned of excesses  China s industrial production and retail sales growth grew slightly mores than expected in September  We wouldn t be surprised to see AUD NZD trade up to 1 14 in the coming weeks  The Canadian dollar  on the other hand  had a relatively uneventful day  The pair traded in a narrow range ahead of Friday s inflation and retail sales reports  Lower oil prices and Canadian bond yields prevented CAD from enjoying the same gains as AUD or EUR  Friday s economic reports will be crucial going into next week s Bank of Canada monetary policy announcement  If retail sales and inflation growth miss expectations  it would reinforce the BoC s less hawkish views  but with USD CAD hovering near 1 2450 support  unexpected strength in spending or inflation could take the pair sharply lower  Sterling traded lower against the greenback but for the third day in a row  it settled above the 50 day SMA near 1 3150  This is notable because Thursday morning s retail sales numbers were significantly weaker than expected and yet GBP still managed to hold support  Economists expected consumer spending to fall by just  0 1  but instead it dropped  0 8   Excluding auto and gas purchases  demand was just as bad with spending falling  0 7    the weakest pace of growth in 4 years  This week s economic reports don t help the case for a rate hike and with the ECB expected to make a move next week  we could see further gains in EUR GBP  Meanwhile  EUR USD rose to a high of 1 1860  despite the Spanish government s decision to invoke Article 155 of the constitution  allowing the central government to suspend Catalonia s autonomy  This is a dangerous step that could lead to more violence if the Catalan people decide to block the measures on the streets  Yet investors have cheered the government s firm stance in doing everything it takes to keep Spain in one piece "
Value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment  After all  who wouldn t want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys  or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios  many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process  Let s put WPP  LON WPP  plc   NASDAQ WPPGY   stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value oriented investors right now  or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks PE RatioA key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio  or PE for short  This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock  and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world  The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock s current PE ratio with  a  where this ratio has been in the past  b  how it compares to the average for the industry sector  and c  how it compares to the market as a whole On this front  WPP plc has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 14 65  as you can see in the chart below This level actually compares pretty favorably with the market at large  as the PE for the S P 500 stands at about 20 19  If we focus on the long term PE trend  WPP plc s current PE level puts it below its midpoint over the past five years Further  the stock s PE also compares favorably with the Zacks classified Advertising and Marketing industry s trailing twelve months PE ratio  which stands at 27 52  At the very least  this indicates that the stock is relatively undervalued right now  compared to its peers We should also point out that WPP plc has a forward PE ratio  price relative to this year s earnings  of just 13 91  so it is fair to say that a slightly more value oriented path may be ahead for WPP plc stock in the near term too P S RatioAnother key metric to note is the Price Sales ratio  This approach compares a given stock s price to its total sales  where a lower reading is generally considered better  Some people like this metric more than other value focused ones because it looks at sales  something that is far harder to manipulate with accounting tricks than earnings Right now  WPP plc has a P S ratio of about 1 48  This is a bit lower than the S P 500 average  which comes in at 3 12 right now  Also  as we can see in the chart below  this is below the highs for this stock in particular over the past few years If anything  WPPGY this suggesting some level of undervalued trading at least compared to historical norms Broad Value OutlookIn aggregate  WPP plc currently has a Zacks Value Style Score of  A   putting it into the top 20  of all stocks we cover from this look  This makes WPP plc a solid choice for value investors  and some of its other key metrics make this pretty clear too For example  the PEG ratio for WPP plc is just 1 42  a level that is lower than the industry average of 1 86  The PEG ratio is a modified PE ratio that takes into account the stock s earnings growth rate  Clearly  WPPGY is a solid choice on the value front from multiple angles What About the Stock Overall  Though WPP plc might be a good choice for value investors  there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name  In particular  it is worth noting that the company has a Growth grade of  C  and a Momentum score of  F   This gives WPPGY a Zacks VGM score or its overarching fundamental grade of  B    You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores  Meanwhile  the company s recent earnings estimates have been encouraging  The full year estimate has seen one upward and no downward revisions in the same time period  This has had just a small impact on the consensus estimate though as the full year estimate has moved higher by 1 4   You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action for the stock in the chart below WPP PLC Price and Consensus    This somewhat favorable trend is why the stock has just a Zacks Rank  2  Buy  and why we are looking for better performance from the company in the near term Bottom LineWPP plc is an inspired choice for value investors  as it is hard to beat its incredible lineup of statistics on this front  Its positive Zacks Rank also indicates robust growth potential in the near future  However  the company s prospects might be constrained due to adverse broader factors  as it has a sluggish industry rank  Bottom 32  out of more than 250 industries   In fact  over the past one year  the Zacks Advertising and Marketing industry has clearly underperformed the broader market  as you can see below So  value investors might want to wait for the broader factors to turn around in this name first  but once that happens  this stock could be a compelling pick More Stock News  8 Companies Verge on Apple Like

"Peloton  which manufactures and sells premium  large screen  stationary fitness bikes and treadmills  as well streaming subscriptions for classes aimed at those using the equipment  is expected to go public sometime in the next few months  It will IPO on the NASDAQ using the ticker  PTON  

The vertically integrated company  designs its equipment and creates its own classes for a global customer base  Nonetheless it bills itself neither as a manufacturer  nor as a service provider  but rather  quoting the third sentence of its S 1 filing  as a  technology company   

That s certainly an overstatement  Customers may enjoy a premium exercise experience in their homes  but  technology  is really only a small part of the offering  and Peloton s business model  Though the company may be building a strong and visible brand  the viability of that business model seems highly suspect 
Revenue and Losses
Revenues are driven primarily by equiment sales  In the U S  the bikes cost  2 245  treadmills go for  4 295 apiece  
The subscription for streaming classes is  39 a month and Peloton describes them as  engaging to the point of addictive   We ll address that below  in the  Subscription Model  section 

Total revenue for fiscal 2019  which ended in June  was  915 million  That s significant growth  110  over the same period the prior year  when the company brought in  435 million  For Peloton  fiscal 2019 was the second year of significant expansion  after it grew 99  in 2018 from  219 million to  435 million 
However  the New York based company s bottom line is far less attractive  Peloton lost  202 million from operations in fiscal 2019  Plus the company plans to ramp up its operating expenses  including marketing and research and development  to support growth for the foreseeable future 
Peloton s expectation is that ultimately profitability will come from subscriptions to its fitness media service  Nonetheless  in fiscal 2019  equipment sales brought in the vast majority of the company s revenue  a trend that doesn t appear to be ending anytime soon 
Bikes and treadmills accounted for  720 million of the total  915 million in revenue  or 78  of the business  The company  which was founded in 2012  says in its filing it has  little history with which to evaluate and predict the profitability of our subscription model   And that s only a part of the rub insofar as actual business growth is concerned 
Brand
Peloton s pricing structure clearly targets an upper class demographic  which makes sense if the company is trying to build an exclusive brand  In recent years  Peloton s premium equipment has been on the radar of an array of celebrities such as Virgin s Richard Branson  olympic sprinter Usain Bolt and actor Hugh Jackman 

This has helped create a cult like following of exercise enthusiasts who swear by Peloton s equipment and classes  Unfortunately the S 1 says Peloton s potential customer base includes households with a  50K per year income  Given the high price point to entry in the Peloton universe  that s doubtful 

Plus it s unlikely equipment prices will come down any time soon  The company spent  324 million on sales and marketing in 2019  at the same time that it spent  410 million manufacturing bikes   

Aside from the feasabilty of its user projections  there are a number of faulty assumptions on the branding front too  As an example  Apple  NASDAQ AAPL  products are considered  premium   Nonetheless  they remain affordable for the most part  A  900 smartphone is a much likelier purchase for less wealthy customers than a  2 200 stationary bike 

Additionally  Apple is arguably the biggest cash cow currently operating in financial markets  Its margins for both software and hardware are impressive  in 2017  TechInsights estimated that the iPhone 8 had gross margins of 59  while the iPhone X provided gross margins of 64   by our estimates Peloton s margins are currently  21   Finally  when Apple  IPO d in 1980  it was already profitable 

As for a strong brand  look no further than Tesla  NASDAQ TSLA   The automaker may have a cult following  but it can t get its financials in order 
Subscription Revenue Model
Peloton currently has 511 000 subscribers  up 108  from the year prior  Nonetheless  it suffers from the same seasonality problem that plagues traditional gyms sales during the quarters surrounding the winter holidays and the new year account for 63  of annual sales 
Perhaps more alarming  churn meaning cancellations minus reactivations is highest in the spring  at 0 79   Over the course of 2019  the company had an average monthly churn of 0 65  or 8  annualized 
That s not insignificant considering how limited the potential customer base for Peleton s equipment will likely be   And though the company offers a  19 a month subscription that s exclusively for streaming yoga and stretching classes which don t depend on the equipment for viewing  churn for this product isn t reported  though the company says it currently has 102 000 subscribers   
ValuationThough Peloton raised  550 million during its last funding round in August 2018 on a valuation of  4 15 billion  its exact IPO valuation has still not been determined  Bloomberg  in February that the valuation could be more than  8 billion   

Companies such as Peloton  which are revenue negative at IPO  are often not immediately judged on their fundamentals  but rather on hype and the hopes of strong future revenue growth  In our view  the growth potential of this stock will all come down to the proposed valuation and how realistically it will hew to future revenue potential 

A long term investment in Peloton is legitimate if you believe it will disrupt gym membership significantly by penetrating the U S  mainstream  even as it gets customers to upgrade equipment  all while building significant revenue from subscriptions 
We re more inclined to believe it will suffer the same fate as other fitness trends such as Fitbit  NYSE FIT   now down 94  from its all time high  reached three months after its 2015 IPO "

	The market was thrilled with the not as bad as feared Apple  NASDAQ AAPL  report from last night  The iPhone maker jumped 6 8  and brought the rest of the technology space along with it  Also  airplane maker Boeing  NYSE BA  easily eclipsed expectations and posted annual revenue of more than  100 billion for the first time ever  The stock was up 6 25

"The US dollar has been heading skyward lately  and the market has been slow to catch on  That s handing you a nice opportunity for gains if you buy the 3 funds I ll show you today 
Before we get into these 3 stealth funds  though  let s step back and look at what s going on 
First  as I wrote in  A  Secret  Way to Ride the Soaring Dollar to 7 6  Dividends  and Gains   when President Trump was elected  he insisted on a  weak dollar  policy to boost US trade and exports  At the same time  the Federal Reserve was worried that the dollar s strength would stoke inflation which was already ticking upward so it was eager to see the dollar fall  as well 
And so it did 
The Dollar Dives

From Trump s surprise win in November 2016 to the end of 2017  the US dollar had its weakest run in a decade  reversing some of the meteoric gains that have been typical in the post Great Recession recovery 
The Greenback s Trump Slump

The decline in the dollar was unprecedented and caused a huge outpouring into foreign assets unlike anything we d seen since the 1990s  Emerging markets were the biggest beneficiaries  Look at the performance of the Vanguard FTSE Emerging Markets  NYSE VWO  in 2017 
Dollar Tanks  Profits Head Offshore

A weaker dollar and therefore stronger currencies in emerging markets meant those countries and companies could borrow more  invest more and grow faster  So it s no surprise their stocks shot up in value at the same time 
Fast forward to today  and the opposite seems to be just starting to happen 
The Dollar Recovers

After more than a year of weakness  the US dollar is suddenly shooting up in value although it s far from bouncing back from the losses it suffered in 2017  If the rise continues  however  the investing landscape will change completely 
Emerging markets are just starting to feel the pinch  VWO is down 2 8  in the last 3 months  and it may be facing further declines if the dollar keeps rising 
So if now is a time to take emerging market profits and put them elsewhere  where can we go to take advantage of the recovering greenback 
The first and most direct place would be in a bullish dollar fund  The PowerShares DB US Dollar Bullish ETF  NYSE UUP  goes up with the dollar  and it s been rising lately although its year to date gains remain modest so far 
Bullish Dollar Fund Just Starting to Makes Its Move

Since UUP is directly tied to the dollar  it s a good first call for investors wanting to profit from the greenback s improving fortunes 
Another  more indirect  approach may be even smarter  though  Investors can benefit from an improving US dollar in the same way VWO buyers benefited from the weaker US dollar  but in reverse  buy US companies 
But you don t want to buy just any American company  Many firms have grown increasingly dependent on foreign sales for growth  Take Apple  NASDAQ AAPL   for instance iPhone sales growth in China has become a main driver for its stock price  and if a stronger dollar drives up iPhone prices in China and causes Chinese customers to reconsider their purchases  Tim Cook s company may take a hit 
Apple  as a growth oriented tech firm  is not typical of   whose management ruthlessly focuses on improving cash flow  The cash flow focus also means those value companies benefit from a stronger dollar because it means they have more buying power to invest and grow operations both in America and abroad much like the emerging markets  native firms benefit from a weaker dollar 
And one way to get into mega cap value companies is with a value ETF like the Vanguard Value  NYSE VTV  or the iShares S P 500 Value  NYSE IVE  
In addition to being well positioned for a strong dollar  these funds also have another advantage  they ve been recently oversold 
Rising Dollar Beneficiaries Still on Sale

While the S P 500  red line here  is up modestly for 2018 thanks to a recent recovery  VTV  blue  is down slightly and IVE  orange  is actually down nearly as much as the S P 500 is up despite the tremendous overlap in companies between the two funds  all of IVE s holdings are S P 500 firms   While UUP has begun to price in the start of the US dollar s recovery  that isn t priced into these value funds at all and that could mean tremendous upside if you hold these funds over the long term 
There s also the fact that these funds are up about 20   on average  over the last 3 years with less volatility than the S P 500  making them one of the safest ways to play the rising US dollar  as well 
Add 8 2  Dividends to Your Dollar Gains
These are all terrific options to bet on the buck  but what if I told you I d found a way for you to grab even bigger gains as the greenback heads higher   and an 8 2  CASH dividend too 
Well  you can  when you buy   Like the 3 ETFs I just showed you  these 4 cash machines are primed to rise right along with the greenback but with one BIG difference  8 2  straight into your pocket in cash year in and year out 
So if you split  say   100 000 out across these 4 cash machines  a full  8 200 would boomerang straight back into your pocket in the first year alone 
That s not all  though  these funds also meet my strict criteria for big  safe profits in today s climate  they re trading at ridiculous discounts to their  true  value and they re purpose built to rise along with the dollar  and interest rates  
So what s the bottom line here 
Simple  my team and I have these 4 off the radar funds pegged for easy 20   upside in the next 12 months  in addition to that fat dividend yield 
That s right we re looking at a near 30  gain  by this time next year 
But the prices on these funds are already starting to inch higher  along with rates and the dollar  You need to make your move now

Will Apple Continue to Fall Far from the Tech Tree 
Do Investors No Longer See the iPhone maker as the Apple of their eye 
Apple as the biggest loser provides you with the opportunity to be the biggest winner


During the past few trading sessions  technology has become the most popular sector to sell  And the most popular stock to sell  That would Apple Inc  NASDAQ AAPL  

Since Friday  when the tech sector sell off began  Apple lost as much as 8  of its value during intraday trade  locking in a 6  decline as of last night s close  This would make Apple the biggest loser of the current sell off  But the real question is whether it s an opportunity for traders to become the biggest winners by getting in on a dip and riding the popular stock higher 
What Goes Up Must Come Down
Apple s previous top was at the  133 35 price levels between February and July 2015  when it formed a Triple Top  On April 28  2015  Apple shares began a fall from a high of  124 54 to the low of  89 47 on May 13  2016  Over this time  the stock lost a third of its value on the disappointment of the Apple Watch 
Since Steve Jobs introduced the first iPhone to the world on January 9  2007  the value of the company s stock has risen over 11 times  from  12 to almost  135  The iPhone changed the world and arguably the company itself forever  And the share price and company valuation were heavily rewarded 

Of course  once the iPhone became a bit more commoditized  Investors needed to see Apple introduce the next  new big thing that would change the world forever  The introduction  in late April  2015 of the Apple Watch unfortunately wasn t that  It was not considered a game changer and disappointed investors rushed out of their positions  triggering a massive selloff 
Not until July 27  2016  when Apple celebrated its one billionth iPhone sold  did the price of its shares break out of the downtrend line  after a rising breakaway gap  Later that year  Samsung s Note 7 debacle gave Apple s stock a boost  but it wasn t until the general US market stock mania after the US election when the so called Trump trade ran amuck that Apple recovered its former market glory  by overcoming the  135 peak  set before the disappointing Apple watch release 
The tech sell off got investors thinking it may be the prelude to an overall market crash  after Goldman Sachs released a report on Friday  comparing the similarities between current markets and market conditions right before the dotcom crash 
However  while the NASDAQ 100 lost 3  in the two day sell off  NASDAQ s Crude Oil Index gained 0 6 percent  since it s positively correlated with the commodity itself  which advanced during those same two days  In addition  the NASDAQ Financial 100 gained 3 6 percent during the same period 0 6 percent more than the NASDAQ 100 s loss since banks are the biggest beneficiaries of what is considered an inevitable rate hike  All things considered then  it appears the NASDAQ sell off was probably nothing more than a sector leadership change  as investors rotate out of growth sectors and into value sectors 
But Does Whatever Goes Down Have To Go Back Up 

So where is Apple s stock likely to go now  That  of course is the trillion dollar question  or actually the  700 billion dollar question  the company s valuation when it peaked on February 2015 
Since Apple has catapulted higher at ever steeper trajectories since 2007  there s a long pathway for its macro uptrend line  The way chart analysts handle this pattern is with  fanning   in which they create trendlines for each of the angles  When one angle is broken  the price is expected to continue to the next  less steep trendline 
Yesterday  Apple fell through its uptrend line that s been in place since November 14  signaling the end of the Trump trade  which ignited the rally  That fall also completed a small double top  in which the May and June peaks at the  155 50 price levels formed the top  and the trough on May 17  with a low of 149 71  forms the neckline 
Price also fell through the 50 dma  Both days of the sell off were backed by very high volume  which lends credence to the continuation of the move  The MACD s shorter moving average fell below the longer one  which in turn fell below the zero line  providing a double sell signal  This occurred on May 19  just two days after the RSI leading indicator broke down  providing a negative divergence when its May peak was lower than its February peak  as opposed to the price action of Apple stock itself 
On the other hand  the stock s ability to climb back from the low of  142 51  which found the support of the 100 dma at  141 48  to the closing price of  145 42 forming a Hammer suggests some investors considered it a dip and were willing to take a chance on the stock 
Will those investors push the stock higher from here  or will the tech sell off resume  Hard to say  since investors who may have once been buyers get spooked at such crossroads  and may continually change sides as fear and or greed drives them 
Stock rotations more often than not play out over time  driven not by the knee jerk selling of the uninitiated but rather by the actions of savvy investors who know that just because one sector falls  it doesn t mean it s over for the stock market  Our assessment then is that the rotation s trend will resume  From a technical standpoint  the breaking of the uptrend line since the US election rally and the completing of the small Double Top suggests the trend of that duration is over  The volume  MACD and the RSI support that 

Trading Strategies
Conservative traders would respect yesterday s hammer and wait for a correction on its potential bounce back with a return move toward the resistance of the broken uptrend line and neckline  and maybe even the psychological resistance of the  150 price level  Should there be no correction  they would wait for the hammer s and 100 dma support to be broken at  141 48 
Cautious traders would wait for a close below the support of the  140 round number  A good place for stop losses would be above those supports  which are expected to turn into resistance 
Moderate traders may wait on a short to yesterday s intraday high of  146 09  on a correction  or for the hammer s and 100dma at 141 48 to be broken 
Aggressive traders would short now "

Analysis of the short term trend is done on a daily basis with the help of hourly charts  It is an important adjunct to the analysis of daily and weekly charts which discusses the course of longer market trends 
Market Overview

 What was thought to have been a distribution pattern turned out to be a re accumulation phase which has given us a pretty good idea of how far this move will carry   Newsletter of 01 07

Because of the unrelenting climb of the stock market  I went back to check the congestion pattern which formed just above the 1810 level which suggests that the bull market has farther to go but when broken down into phases  there is a phase count pointing to an important top in this general area  This is also confirmed by the re accumulation pattern whichmaterializedat the 2685 level 
We have entered the potential target range that is suggested with the price action of the past couple of weeksrising exponentially  The little congestion area which formed late Friday may be one of the last stepping stones to the maximum count derived from the 2685 pattern 
Bar charts do not show clearly the amount of congestion which forms at consolidation levels  but Point   Figure charts do  and by some mysterious coincidence  the count always seems to closely match the Fibonacci calculations determining the length of EWT waves  It could have been construed that the wave which has been under way from the 2000 level would end at 2695  but market action quickly suggested that another extension of that wave had formed which had the potential of reaching the current price range in the S P 500  However  in doing so  it has been stretched to the limit another reason to believe that we are reaching an area from which an important correction   whichcould be sharp    should start  Another possibility is that the momentum will subside gradually and form a series of near term lows and highs thereby building a distribution top for a few weeks before starting a correction of at least one hundred points into the May time frame 
 
Chart Analysis These charts and subsequent ones courtesy of QCharts 
S P 500 daily chart
The title of last week s letter was   A Little Euphoria   This action did not abate during thepast few days  in spite of a brief correction   but actually increased  giving the daily chart an exponential look into Friday s close  While it is not easy to predict when such a move will end   until it has    we do have a count  price  as well as a cycle  time  projection suggesting that we are essentially there  If correct  a top should begin to manifest itself over the near future 
It is interesting that the A D pattern of selling into the high volume opening gap was again apparent on Friday  as it took the A D index down to 36 by 1 30  Although it recovered to 262 by the close  it s obvious that this is a poor breadth showing for a 19 point day  I believe that it indicates that professionals  which have large positions  are liquidating into market strength 
The advance has now taken the index beyond the top line of all the channels discussed last week  an area where it should have found resistance  History suggests that this type of action is short lived  normally ending in a sharp reversal  Is this what s in store for next week  We shall see  We should also note that during the 370 point move since August  16  the index has only had two normal 20 point corrections  and a 50 pointnews induced panic which only lasted a couple of hours 
I had suggested earlier that the rally would end when trend line  1 was broken  It was only breached slightly at the end of December by a truncated 20 wk cycle low  There is now an even steeper trend line for the January portion of the rally which will have to be broken first 

S P 500 hourly chart 
The hourly chart shows the index action since that 2 hour panic of 50 points The flat segment highlighted in green represents the last re accumulation pattern from which I drew the confirming count of a little over one hundred points on the P F chart  which has already taken us to where we are  There are six open gaps since the 2676 low  and many more if we start counting from the August low  This is another reason why this price action is not sustainable  But we have a more reliable price timecompletion suggested for the rally which was discussed earlier 
A couple of minor cycles due next week could bring a minor correction as a preview to the final high  This is also what the negative divergence which appeared on the oscillators by the end of the day is suggesting  The lowest one is the A D differential  Theselling which took place in the first hour is marked with a red asterisk 
The thin uptrend line is the former  trend line  1  which was only violated at the end of December  I have redrawn it lower to take into consideration the year end low of 2675  But the first trend line to give way  should be the short  thin one created last week  It blends with the  pink  9 hr MA which  as you can see  has done a good job of tracking prices over the near term 

An overview of some important indexes  daily charts 
In the FAANGs last week  Facebook  NASDAQ FB  corrected on Friday and Apple  NASDAQ AAPL  only reached its former high while the others continued to show strength  In the lower tier  semiconductors appear to have topped  but the other three are still strong  We ll have to see more corrective patterns starting before a top becomes apparent 

PowerShares DB US Dollar Bullish  NYSE UUP   dollar ETF 
UUP renewed its decline  threatening to make new lows  No sign of strength there 

GDX  NYSE GDX   Gold miners ETF 
GDX is overcoming the resistance band  but the move from about 21 may soon end  This last advance looks like a wave 5 which should have a limited push higher  with 24 50 a possibility  Afterward  a correction should develop which could continue into the 8 10 wk cycles bottoming in late February 

USO  United States Oil Fund  NYSE USO  
USO has reached its 12 50 13 00 basic projection  but coud push a little higher before starting to correct  This also looks like a wave 5 which should soon complete 

Summary
S P 500 is ostensibly approaching a time price projection  but it could hesitate reaching the final high before having an intermediate reversal even though it is in sight unless the move ends in a buying climax which would bring about a sharp correction near term  before a period of distribution begins "
For Immediate ReleaseChicago  IL   February 22  2018   Zacks com announces the list of stocks featured in the Analyst Blog  Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets  Stocks recently featured in the blog include Walmart   NYSE WMT    Cisco   NASDAQ CSCO    Intel   NASDAQ INTC    UPS   NYSE UPS   and Wynn Resorts   NASDAQ WYNN   Here are highlights from Wednesday s Analyst Blog  Top Stock Reports for Walmart  Cisco  Intel   UPSThe Zacks Research Daily presents the best research output of our analyst team  Today s Research Daily features new research reports on 17 major stocks  including Walmart  Cisco  Intel and UPS  These research reports have been hand picked from the roughly 70 reports published by our analyst team today Buy rated Walmart s shares have been strong performers lately  with the stock up  17 6  over the last six months  outperforming the S P 500 s  10 9  gain in the same time period  Walmart  which recently emerged as an omni channel retailer officially  has been riding on constant growth efforts   both in stores and online The company s robust e commerce initiatives  like buyouts  alliances  online grocery and improved delivery systems have been working well  These trends helped Walmart post its 14th straight quarter of U S  comps growth in fourth quarter fiscal 2018  wherein earnings and sales rose year over year However  gross margin remained strained owing to mix impact from growing e commerce operations  price investments and higher markdowns  Also  the rate of e commerce growth slowed down sequentially Nevertheless  management expects U S  e commerce sales to jump nearly 40  in fiscal 2019  which should help the company revert to its track of surpassing the industry  The Zacks analyst expects these factors and projected gains from tax reforms to fuel the bottom line Shares of Buy rated Cisco have outperformed the Zacks Networking industry over the past year  gaining  29 3  vs   27 3   Cisco reported impressive second quarter fiscal 2018 results  Both earnings and revenues increased on a year over year basis  The growth was driven by strong contribution from acquisitions  security  Infrastructure Platforms and applications The Zacks analyst thinks the company s expanding footprint in the rapidly growing security market presents a significant growth opportunity  Additionally  partnerships with Telenor  Apple  NASDAQ AAPL   IBM  NYSE IBM   Microsoft  NASDAQ MSFT   Google  NASDAQ GOOGL  Cloud  Viacom and Alibaba  NYSE BABA  and aggressive share buybacks are other positives  However  weakness in the switching and routing is a headwind Moreover  ongoing transition to subscription based model will continue to hurt the top line  Further  weakness in the service provider business segment and intense competition from the likes of Huawei  Juniper and Arista Networks are other major concerns Buy rated Intel s shares have underperformed the Zacks General Semiconductor industry over the past one year  gaining  28 5  vs   53 3   However  Intel reported stellar fourth quarter results and provided an encouraging guidance  The company is benefiting from robust performance of the DCG  IoT Group  NSG and PSG  These segments form the crux of Intel s data centric business model Further  the launch of FPGA SDK for OpenCL solution  Xeon Scalable  Core 8 chips  Myriad X and next generation desktop processors are key catalysts  Lately  Intel s Movidius vision processing has gained strong adoption  The processor was selected by Alphabet s Google division and Amazon  NASDAQ AMZN  com s DeepLens  Intel also announced level through five autonomous driving platform based on EyeQ5 and Atom  which will sample over the next few months Its partnerships with BMW  Nissan  Volkswagen  DE VOWG p  AG and Ferrari  NYSE RACE  will boost sales of processing chips  sensor chips  cloud software and many more  which will drive top line growth  However  stiff competition from peers adds to its woes Shares of Buy rated UPS have underperformed the Zacks Air Freight and Cargo industry as well as rival FedEx  NYSE FDX  in a year s time  While UPS has lost  0 9   the industry it belongs to and FedEx have rallied  8 7  and  24 3   respectively  Despite the unimpressive price performance  UPS outperformed in the fourth quarter of 2017 Also  revenues and earnings per share improved year over year  Results were aided by strong export volumes  Moreover  UPS performed well in the most recent holiday season on the back of e commerce growth  In February 2018  UPS announced its decision to increase quarterly dividends which is an added positive Furthermore  the new tax law  Tax Cuts and Jobs Act   which reduces corporate tax rate significantly  is encouraging  However  high costs continue to limit bottom line growth  Its forecast for 2018 capex  which is higher than 2017 levels  might push up costs further Other noteworthy reports we are featuring today include Wynn Resorts Today s Stocks from Zacks  Hottest StrategiesIt s hard to believe  even for us at Zacks  But while the market gained  18 8  from 2016

The Zacks Research Daily presents the best research output of our analyst team  Today s Research Daily features new research reports on 16 major stocks  including Verizon Communications  VZ   PepsiCo  PEP  and Biogen  BIIB   These research reports have been hand picked from the roughly 70 reports published by our analyst team today 
You can see 
Verizon s shares have outperformed the Zacks Wireless National industry over the past year  7 4  vs  5 3    The Zacks analyst believes that Verizon has embarked on a new operating structure with Verizon 2 0 that aims to align the business model with evolving customer needs 
Focus on online content delivery  mobile video and online advertising will likely drive future growth  Verizon aims to cut costs through employee reduction and divestments as it ramps up investment in its next generation 5G network  which is expected to be the next growth driver  The company has also upped the ante against rivals by launching the 5G Ultra Wideband network in select locations of the country 
However  it continues to struggle in a competitive U S  wireless market  The company s wireline division is struggling with losses in access lines due to competitive pressure from VoIP service providers  Verizon is spending heavily on promotion and lucrative discounts to woo customers and this leads to margin contraction  
 You can  
Shares of PepsiCo have gained 13 4  in the past six months  outperforming the Zacks Soft Drinks Beverages industry s rise of 8  over the same period  The Zacks analyst believes that company s productivity savings goal of at least  1 billion annually through 2023 bodes well 
The company s earnings and sales beat in third quarter 2019 was driven by strength in all segments and robust pricing  This marked its ninth sales beat in the last 11 quarters  with positive earnings surprise in 14 of the last 15 quarters  Moreover  PepsiCo now expects organic revenues for 2019 to meet or exceed 4  growth stated previously 
However  the unfavorable impact of ongoing investments to strengthen business  a higher tax rate  and the absence of asset sale and refranchising gains that occurred in 2018 are likely to hurt PepsiCo s earnings in 2019  Adverse currency rates are also likely to hurt the company s results in 2019 
 You can   
Biogen s shares have lost 5  in the past three months compared with the Zacks Biomedical and Genetics industry s decline of 9 1   The Zacks analyst likes Biogen s efforts to diversify beyond MS to other areas like Alzheimer s  Parkinson s and stroke  Meanwhile  Spinraza has multi billion dollar potential 
Biogen regularly in licenses assets to build its pipeline with several candidates that have transformative potential  Several data readouts are expected in 2019 2020 with multiple potential launches in the early 2020s  However  Biogen is heavily reliant on sales of its drugs for MS  which is a highly competitive disease space  Potential competition to Spinraza from competitors  gene therapy programs for SMA is a concern 
Though Biogen s CNS pipeline is attractive  it is a high risk area  The stock has underperformed the industry this year  Estimates have remained stable ahead of Q2 earnings  Biogen has a positive record of earnings surprises in the recent quarters

"CNBC s Sara Eisen asked me last Tuesday if I was still bearish on one of Wall Street and Goldman Sachs Group Inc s  NYSE GS  favorite stocks  even after it had already fallen more than 45  since I warned you last May that it was a bad investment 
 You know this environment  Keith   she told me   People are paying up for growth companies  The bulls would say this has great brand presence  great brand awareness  and is continuing a careful and steady expansion in the U S  and abroad  
All excellent points  I replied  but not one of them changes the fact that a tiny company taking market share from huge competitors in a non growth market does not make it a growth stock 
Then I went for the jugular 
 if this company traded in line with its biggest competitor  the company s stock price would be only  0 66 a share  or 98 22  less than Goldman Sachs suggests 
Here s why this stock s bulls are still in for plenty of heartburn 
When I first pointed to Shake Shack Inc   NYSE SHAK  as an investment to avoid last May  the company was trading at roughly 1 200 times earnings   in an industry that had an average price earnings  P E  ratio of 40  That s come down to a forward P E of  only  376  according to Yahoo   NASDAQ YHOO  Finance  now that the stock has fallen by 35  
The bulls take this as a sign of encouragement  noting that the company s stock is somehow more reasonable at  60 a share than it was at  90 
Don t fall for it 
There s still plenty of potential heartburn on the menu 
Shake Shack remains a highly speculative company at best  and not the investment millions of people think it is  Here are five reasons why 
1  Insiders are bailing out 
Shake Shack recently filed for a secondary offering of up to 4 million shares on the eve of the expiration of the company s IPO lock up period  According to U S  Securities and Exchange Commission documents  sellers include Chairman Danny Meyer  Green Equity Investors VI  and LP SEG Partners LP  and the chain will not receive a dime 
If they believed Shake Shack stock was cheap and that the company had better days ahead  they d be holding on or even buying more 
Individual investors are the last in line when it comes to making money from initial public offerings 
Further  a company like Shake Shack couldn t have been brought public a decade ago  when you had to have results rather than just  potential  
2  SHAK still trades at an unwarranted premium compared to the competition 

I realize this is hard to internalize  so let me break it down another way by using the value per restaurant as of last May 

Do you really believe that Shake Shack is worth  50 million per location 
The markets didn t  and I still don t 
In fact  if the Shack is going to achieve a McDonald s like valuation per location  the company would have to do this 
They d have to open approximately 864 restaurants representing a 1 170  expansion from the 68 locations they operate today 
If it traded at a P E ratio comparable to McDonald s  NYSE MCD    16 5 until weak earnings pushed the P E up recently    the company that recorded earnings of just  0 04 per share last quarter would be priced at  0 66 per share  That s 98 22  less than Goldman Sachs  target price of  37 00 per share 
3  Labor costs are going up 
That s going to be problematic for the simple reason that this will eat into margins  Critics claim labor doesn t matter  Evidently they haven t been to Seattle  where the Washington Restaurant Association s Anthony Anton observed that higher wages are not a political problem but  rather  a  math problem  
According to Anton  36  of typical Seattle restaurant funds go to labor  30  to food  and 30  to all other operational costs  with only 4  remaining as profit  That means there s only  28 000 in profit for a restaurant producing  700 000 a year  Just meeting the new  15 an hour legally mandated minimum wage will push labor expenses from 42  to 47  
It doesn t take a rocket scientist to figure out that prices will go up  fewer people will dine out  and there will be less money to go around  Adding insult to injury  revenue declines  margins rise  and profits fall 
Earnings will naturally follow over time 
4  Shake Shack s menu is complicated and the service sequence is slow 
These two things are critical to any restaurant chain that wants to scale up  You ve got to get the food out quickly and at a fair price that justifies the wait once the fad fades and reality catches up  Shake Shack reminds me of Krispy Kreme  NYSE KKD   right before customers realized that it s very difficult to differentiate a donut  let alone make it  worth  the premium menu price

5  The metrics don t justify the valuation 
Growth advocates often like to say that a company will grow into the price the market has assigned to it  so they re willing to  pay up   That s fine if you re talking about an especially promising tech company like Apple  NASDAQ AAPL  or even Tesla  NASDAQ TSLA   but completely delusional for a hamburger chain 
Think about it 
Even if the company s westward expansion is a  runway for Shake Shack   as Jim Cramer rhapsodized  the burger chain s empire will only consist of a few hundred stores within the next couple of years 
Assign it a 50  profit margin  to be generous  for the  9 Shack Stack cheese and  shroom burger  and the company needs to sell 480 million burgers in a year to justify the current  2 16 billion market capitalization  McDonald s margins are 16   and they sell 75 burgers a second while feeding close to 1  of the world s population each day  according to Yahoo  Finance  Business Insider  and the company itself 
Can you really look at yourself in the mirror and make the argument that s going to happen with only 68 locations and less than 2 000 employees 
I can t 
And finally  what s happening with Shake Shack is a very serious warning that the markets have become frothy and that investors are chasing hot ideas rather than results 
Never forget that it s one thing to buy a story stock and quite another to hold it for three years 
 then find a greater fool who ll buy it "
Value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment  After all  who wouldn t want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys  or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value  One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios  many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process  Let s put Capital One Financial Corporation   NYSE COF   stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value oriented investors right now  or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks PE RatioA key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio  or PE for short  This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock  and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world  The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock s current PE ratio with  a  where this ratio has been in the past  b  how it compares to the average for the industry sector  and c  how it compares to the market as a whole On this front  Capital One Financial has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 8 47  as you can see in the chart below This level actually compares pretty favorably with the market at large  as the PE for the S P 500 stands at about 19 36  If we focus on the long term PE trend  Capital One Financial s current PE level puts it below its midpoint of 10 29 over the past five years  Moreover  the current level stands well below the highs for the stock  suggesting that it can be a solid entry point Further  the stock s PE also compares favorably with the Zacks Finance sector s trailing twelve months PE ratio  which stands at 14 07  At the very least  this indicates that the stock is relatively undervalued right now  compared to its peers We should also point out that Capital One Financial has a forward PE ratio  price relative to this year s earnings  of just 8 67  which is higher than the current level  So  it is fair to expect an increase in the company s share price in the near term P S RatioAnother key metric to note is the Price Sales ratio  This approach compares a given stock s price to its total sales  where a lower reading is generally considered better  Some people like this metric more than other value focused ones because it looks at sales  something that is far harder to manipulate with accounting tricks than earnings  Right now  Capital One Financial has a P S ratio of about 1 37  This is a bit lower than the S P 500 average  which comes in at 3 36x right now  Also  as we can see in the chart below  this is well below the highs for this stock in particular over the past few years If anything  this suggests some level of undervalued trading at least compared to historical norms Broad Value OutlookIn aggregate  Capital One Financial currently has a Value Score of A  putting it into the top 20  of all stocks we cover from this look  This makes Capital One Financial a solid choice for value investors  and some of its other key metrics make this pretty clear too  For example  the P CF ratio  another great indicator of value  comes in at 5 78  which is far better than the industry average of 6 15  Clearly  COF is a solid choice on the value front from multiple angles  What About the Stock Overall Though Capital One Financial might be a good choice for value investors  there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name  In particular  it is worth noting that the company has a Growth Score of C and a Momentum Score of B  This gives COF a Zacks VGM score   or its overarching fundamental grade   of A   You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores  Meanwhile  the company s recent earnings estimates have been solid at best  The current quarter has seen six estimates go higher in the past sixty days compared to two lower  while the full year estimate has seen five up and three down in the same time period  This has had a negative impact on the consensus estimate though as the current quarter consensus estimate has dropped by 0 8  in the past two months  while the full year estimate has inched lower by 1 8   You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action for the stock in the chart below Capital One Financial Corporation Price and Consensus   Apart from this somewhat soft trend  the stock has just a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  which is why we are looking for in line performance from the company in the near term  Bottom LineCapital One Financial is an inspired choice for value investors  as it is hard to beat its incredible lineup of statistics on this front  Further  a strong industry rank  among Top 35  of more than 250 industries  instills our confidence  However  over the past two years  the Zacks Financial   Consumer Loans industry has clearly underperformed the broader market  as you can see below So  value investors might want to wait for estimates and analyst sentiment to turn around in this name first  but once that happens  this stock could be a compelling pick  More Stock News

This chart review covers the following stocks  Apple  AAPL   Amazon com  AMZN   Best Buy  BBY   Skull Candy  SKUL   Priceline com  PCLN   Hewlett Packard  HPQ   and Caterpillar  CAT   Apple  AAPL  In retrospect  last Monday s plunge now looks like some kind of  manipulation   The stock plunged 3 2  on no immediate news so the selling looked like follow through to the previous week s selling  I was quick to note the rarity of a Monday sell off of such magnitude and projected AAPL would end the week another 2  or so lower  Two days later the stock was rallying and hit a crossroads between the 50 and 200 day moving averages  DMAs   By Friday  AAPL had essentially closed the week flat  A lot of outsized volatility and churn that turned out to be essentially meaningless overall  Now  the stock sits just below its 50DMA after failing to punch through the downtrending 20DMA  Friday also formed a bearish engulfing pattern  Despite all that  I bet on another up Monday given the high odds projected by my the Apple Trading Model  ATM    The model managed a 3 2 performance last week   I will now be posting the regression tress  classification  on Google drive for each set of historical data  2010  2011  2012  and 2013  Apple closed for another down Friday  The loss deepened mainly thanks to a sudden plunge in the stock that occurred in the last 15 minutes of trading  I show the intraday chart below  Looks like AAPL started and ended the week with some suspicious selling pressure Amazon com  AMZN  AMZN is honestly driving me crazy  It is bad enough that I cannot understand why it continues to hit all time highs  Worse is the post earnings churn that flips the stock from bullish to bearish and back to bullish trading  quite different than the more consistent patterns of earlier that formed the AMZN post earnings model  link takes you to a Google docs spreadsheet   My last trade was a put spread after AMZN flipped the bearish post earnings signal  The trade was good for about two weeks but the stock lost a maximum of about 3 5  before launching into its current recovery  It was not enough to take me out of my put spread profitably and I held on in vain for renewed selling pressure  The stock exhibited impressive relative strength to close the week at fresh all time highs after bouncing perfectly off its 50DMA on Tuesday  Sept 17th  Best Buy  BBY  Speaking of Amazon com  remember how mobile price checks on Amazon com s site were supposed to be killing Best Buy s business  Remember when BBY was supposedly a dying company that had only its founder and former CEO as a last desperate hope for survival through a private buyout  That all seems like a distant memory as BBY has managed to rally consistently since the 2012 Christmas holiday nadir  The stock is now up a mind boggling 223  this year  and I do not see anyone talking about how bad BBY s business is anymore  Amazing how sentiment can change so much faster than the real business  After the last earnings call  I decided to open a small short position  The valuation has  normalized  with a 14 forward P E and 3 7 P B ratio  both higher than Walmart  WMT   Only the P S ratio is still relatively small at 0 28  At current levels  BBY is a perfect hedge on  something  going wrong with the economy  market sentiment  the consumer retail  or any of a whole host of risk factors  Beyond that  I think sentiment will take a complete roundtrip sooner than later  It just needs a catalyst Skull Candy  SKUL  You can still find Skull Candy audio accessories in Best Buy  but the company sure seemed on its last threads after the last Christmas shopping season  I still owe readers a fresh review of the company to explain why I am STILL long  On Friday  hope sprung eternal with SKUL FINALLY breaking out of a six month consolidation pattern on high volume  This is quite a bullish development and represents a strong potential for a bottom  Perhaps SKUL can rise like a Phoenix BBY style  SKUL will have to have a decent Christmas shopping season to have any hope of sustaining a breakout move  Brace yourselves Priceline com  PCLN  I am really just including PCLN because I like posting about a  1000 stock  Congrats to all the PCLN bulls that have made it to this major milestone  PCLN is up an incredible 62  this year and still looks unstoppable  The poor economic conditions in Europe are clearly not impacting enthusiasm for the stock Hewlett Packard  HPQ  HPQ has been working on its own incredible comeback from the ashes of PC related angst  Until the company can come up with a non PC answer to the rapid move to mobile devices  I cannot see this renaissance lasting much longer  Indeed  August earnings disappointed and now the stock is threatening a fresh break below its 200DMA  Such a breakdown would make HPQ a classic short  It is a company that will not get bought  anytime soon   so you can actually sleep OK holding it overnight  Aggressive shorts could even add to the position on a relief rally dead cat bounce back to 50DMA resistance  A break below the 200DMA will add HPQ to the GROWING ranks of companies whose momentum points in the opposite direction of the general stock market Caterpillar  CAT  I have long maintained that CAT is like the canary in the coal mine for the stock market  2013 has proven to be quite an exception  CAT has traded down year to date for most of the year  missing huge on the great rally of 2013  Since trading down to flatline year to date in late February  CAT has traded in a wide range  Last week  the stock survived issuing guidance at the Citi Global Industrials Conference and then more bearish talk from famous short seller Jim Chanos who has a large short position in CAT  But on Friday  out of seemingly nowhere  CAT plunged over 3 4   Like AAPL  my first thought is options related manipulation  but I do not have access to data to even make an educated guess  Overall  CAT is dead money until it either breaks out or breaks down  I am including it here just because Friday s high volume selling woke me up and caught my attention  I am watching ever more closely  especially since I still own a small amount of shares   Be careful out there Full disclosure  long AAPL shares and calls  long SKUL  long CAT  short BBY
MS All In There is a big crowd of analysts that seem to be stuck with overly optimistic forecasts for Apple  AAPL   For example  Citi  C  did a bearish story on America s favorite stock yesterday  but even with the bad news  Citi still thinks the stock should be  75 higher   Morgan Stanley  MS  is behind on what s looking like a bad call  the folks with the white spats doubled down yesterday  The one year outlook for AAPL is to trade at  714  with a potential upside as high as  980   That s a big call for a stock that has lost  187B of market cap the past few months  equivalent to 3 Goldman Sachs  5 Starbucks or 10 Dells   Who knows  Maybe all these bulls are right  That rarely happens  What bothers me with the MS update on AAPL is that the firm sees the downside in the stock at close to zero  no lower than  495   That s never true  Talk to those who have been saying it has been a screaming buy the last  200  Me and JA I ve been a member of JA most of my adult life  This important turning point came after I became addicted to the most powerful narcotic on earth  Like most addicts  I lost everything that I had  Were it not for JA  I probably would not be around writing blogs   Today  I m somewhat of elder statesman for this very private group  The grey hair and the decades without re addiction have provided me some status  I keep in contact with senior JA members around the world  I do my own  self help  sessions with those who have recently fallen prey to this poison  Using this global network  I can observe the trends of those who become newly addicted  and also those poor souls who fall off the wagon  and make the fateful call to their favorite dealer   I have distressing news to report  The JA  Help  lines have been ringing off the hook  Tens of thousands of JA members  many of whom have been  living clean  for more than a decade  have started abusing the drug again  Worse still  is the explosive increase in first time users   85  first time users become hopelessly addicted   10Xs greater then heroin    The full name for what is familiarly known as JA is  Japan Short Anonymous  JSA  or just JA   The group is patterned off of Alcoholics Anonymous  many JA members are also in AA   The only qualifications for joining JA are the loss of a great deal of money  and the willingness to  privately  admit to being a self destructive yen shorter   Okay  I m kidding  again  But I m not kidding about the betting against Japan  It s huge  both in the currency and debt markets  For the past few months  money has been making money on the short side of Japan  Nothing fans the short trade more than success   This is the most seductive trade in the world  that s why folks get addicted to it  I m not going to re iterate the dozen odd reasons why Japan Inc  is a screaming short  And I agree with the conventional wisdom that Abe is going to print to oblivion  and that  by itself  is good reason to rev up the short engines   It s possible that Short Japan is the trade of the next decade  a perpetual short that fuels the carry trade  But then again  this trade has killed tens of thousands over the past thirty years   PS   I wasn t kidding about swearing off of the short yen trade 30 odd years ago  And I must admit  even I ve had that old  itch  of late   A Great Deal  This is an update on an old story  This is about Munis and leverage   Towson MD did a deal recently where it borrowed  256m for 30 years at a very sweet 3 43   The money raised went into the Towson municipal employees  retirement fund  Some details  Last summer the financial deep thinkers in Towson re calibrated their investment returns on their  2b investment fund  The assumed rate of return had been a ridiculously high 7 875   it was changed to a much more  conservative  assumption of 7 25   It should be 5    The drop in the benchmark return produced a whopping  760m hole in the Fund  Vs  the  2 4B it would be at 5    The net present value of that hole comes to a much more manageable  250m Rather than raise taxes on the citizens  or cut future benefits for employees  Towson took the  bold  action of just borrowing the money and hoping like hell that it all sorts out over the next twenty odd years I don t get it  and I don t like it  Think of this from the perspective of the taxpayers  They are borrowing money at 3 43  in the hope that they can earn a much higher return  I think Towson is gambling  Consider the investment portfolio Note that 27  is fixed income  Towson is a high grade yield buyer The  stuff that Towson invests in has a yield today that is less than the cost of the new debt  This means that the results on the the other 73  of the portfolio has to be that much higher in order for Towson to achieve its new hurdle rate of 7 25   I look at the 15 year chart of the S P and wonder what happens if stocks don t go up a steady 8   for the next many years  Anyway  Mr  Kamentz  the County Exec  for Towson  had this to say when his borrowing deal got inked    Funding the pension fund in this manner protects employee benefits and shows taxpayers that we are serious about managing our budget    Egad   Wall Street loves pension obligation deals  The Street makes money in every direction  WS gets paid to issue and place the debt  it makes money trading the debt after it s issued  it makes more money selling the stocks and bonds that Towson buys with the debt  it earns custodial fees for all the paper that is created and it gets nice advisory fees  Towson spent  14m in 2011 on fees  that number will go up every year for the next 30  I don t have a list of the munis that have done Pension Obligation bond deals  nor the gross amount of this swill that is now outstanding  does anyone   I do know that many munis have done this  the amounts are big  It s a time bomb

Fed decides as oversees economic data and company earnings show signs of further distress
Disappointing overseas earnings and weak global economic data offer a credible justification for lower interest rates in the U S  The Federal Reserve  Fed  will likely cut the Fed funds rate by 25 basis points today  if not more  as FOMC members will accentuate the rising downside risks due to a weakening global economy  that could hit the U S  businesses sooner rather than later if they do not act now 
The Fed could still surprise the market with a 50 basis point cut  but such action would make it harder to keep the market motivated in the coming quarters  as a larger cut today would require larger cuts in the future as well  The Fed may want to avoid such commitment and to have a better control on investors by keeping the possibility of more cuts on the table instead of going full blast lower at today s meeting  The probability of a 50 basis point cut is down to 18  according to the pricing in US treasury markets 
Doves  reaction to a 25 basis point cut should remain limited as lower Fed rates are fully integrated in asset prices  unless Jerome Powell sounds more dovish than he already did over the past month  But we cannot underestimate the power of Powell s speech  as he has managed to keep the doves inspired despite strong economic data over the past weeks 
Speaking of strong data  the ADP employment report due before the Fed decision  should confirm that the U S  economy added 150 000 new nonfarm jobs in July  higher than 102 000 printed a month earlier  A better than expected figure could cheer investors up  with the Fed s growing emphasize on what s turning bad elsewhere rather than what s doing good at home "

"Stock down 20 
We wake up today to the latest carnage in the GoPro  O GPRO  stock  down another 20  on weak earnings  poor guidance  and a 7  cut in its workforce  There are several things the company could have executed on so that the stock would have held up much better than its near Calvary stampede from  94 a share to effectively  11 a share on a direct line down  For example  they could have followed the Apple  O AAPL  model and come out with a much better device every nine months with new features that blow the previous model out of the water 
Poor Execution
They could have executed better on the strategy of building a brand around the media aspect of the company  They could have used their lofty stock price to buy other companies and diversify their revenue stream  As even they knew their stock was over valued at the time  this is why everyone who could sell at the company was cashing in as soon as any lockout barriers were removed or circumvented in the case of the CEO with his charity fund  They could have branched out with new devices to diversify from being labeled the Camera on a stick company  But they didn t  and it looks more and more that their heart wasn t in it after getting their big payday in hitting the IPO jackpot 

Salesman are always closing
Nick Woodman talked a good game  this guy is straight out of the salesman s clich  catalogue  He is good looking  young and charismatic and the tech industry was at its height of popularity  with markets at all time highs and tech valuations garnering ridiculous valuations his spiel is even more believable  But come on  when a company fails to execute as much as this company failed  it is obvious that leadership was on the banquet circuit more than running a company 
How hard is it not to make some  marketing  engineering changes to the main product and come out with a new model every nine months  But I am not going to be too hard on GoPro because they did come out with an initial product that people liked  and you cannot really blame them for maximizing their 15 minutes Cash In Window  Not everyone wants to grind out a company for 15 years like Steve Jobs 
IPO Lottery Ticket
But the bigger picture is to focus for investors on what IPOs are in many cases  The reason companies come to market in bull markets is to maximize their payday  that should be a warning sign for investors right there  An IPO that comes to market in a bear market is much more legitimate from the starting point  Moreover  there is a game that goes on in the market with IPOs  and I will lay it out here

Hedge Funds love to run up IPOs  they identify a company that has a sexy product  a sexy story  something that can be sold to the market as a growth company  Then they look for a relatively small float which makes it easier to push up or manipulate  The play is this  Buy the stock in the pre market as much as they can get their hands on  get together with a couple of other hedge funds and team up to push the stock up after the IPO comes to market  pushing the sexy story  and letting the media just hype the stock for them 
Nick Woodman with his charming smile and personality was the perfect pitchman for this scheme  Then of course as the stock continues to rise  value investors come in to short the stock on valuation concerns  This only adds fuel to the fire as these investors get blown out of the water by the hedge funds who just have more buying power and momentum on their side  This causes the stock to go higher than it would otherwise  Additional  smart money  knows the stock is now over valued so they come in to short the stock  but the original shorters are still new buyers  and technical buyers come in and initiate a second  and third  and fourth short squeeze until finally everyone has given up on shorting the stock as they have all been liquidated  Never short a hot IPO  wait until everyone and their mother has been squeezed out of their short  and then wait for confirmation  The best way is to then do this in the options market  but wait for several short squeezes before buying your deep out of the money puts 
Options is where the major money is made on these plays
Then the hedge funds buy a bunch of puts on the stock and start unwinding their substantial positions and ride the stock all the way down  adding additional shorts to the market  and fueling the downside carnage  And if they can get a company that fails to execute like GoPro the more the better from a profit standpoint  Now not all IPOs are as lucrative with this scheme as GoPro has been  But on average this is a pretty standard strategy with regard to IPOs  enough so that hedge funds have formed a game plan around how best to play these IPO games  and makes fortunes manipulating them up and down in this manner  It is one of the oldest games on the street 

Conclusion
Therefore  stay away from most IPOs  even legitimate companies like Alibaba  N BABA  exhibited this same run it up after the IPO  then dump it like a rock strategy  Always wait for the pullback  like in Facebook  O FB  and look for growth in quarterly earnings that are going to be the rare growth momentum 10 bagger plus models like Google  O GOOGL   Baidu  NASDAQ BIDU   etc  But many IPOs are scams that come to market for their lottery ticket 
 You think Yahoo  O YHOO  ever made any money off of Mark Cuban s scam IPO market offering  That s why many of these sales types comes to market with some flashy business model that just isn t going to generate solid quarterly earning s growth over the long haul  And these companies just play into the IPO scam market game of pushing the stocks up to ridiculous levels  blow out the shorts  and then take them down like an avalanche  The scheme is highly profitable  just avoid being a victim and stay away from most IPOs "
HBO s fancy drama  Game of Thrones  is now in its eighth and final session  The captivating TV series is all over encore telecasts  DVR playback  on demand  HBO Go and HBO Now   The final series  consisting of six episodes  premiered on Apr 14 and is expected to wrap up on May 19  The finale  no doubt  is the most talked about since Breaking Bad in September 2013  And it surely should outshine the series finale of The Big Bang Theory on May 16 on CBS  Lest we forget  CBS currently has twice the distribution of HBO  The medieval fantasy TV series is based on a well liked book series  A Song of Ice and Fire by George R R  Martin  and is likely to lure viewers as long as the creators continue to produce enthralling plots and don t deviate far from the book   Talking about the level of interest  let s take a look at why the fantasy series continued to gain popularity    Game of Thrones Rides High When Game of Thrones debuted in 2011  it garnered an average of 9 3 million audiences  And in the seventh season  the average viewership went up to 32 8 million  Very few series have increased viewership every season  with AMC s Breaking Bad  aired between 2008 and 2013  being an exception  So  what are the reasons for Game of Thrones  success  First of all  let s admit it has a fantastic content line up  and is undoubtedly a quality show  Otherwise  why would this series be nominated for a whopping 132 Emmy Awards and eventually win 47  way more than any other drama series  The much liked series has already won the Emmy Award for Best Drama three times  The series  by the way  is readily available  And that increases the viewership  While nearly 10 3 million watch Game of Thrones on HBO  around 22 5 million watch the show on streaming sites  Game of Thrones also has limited episodes compared to other series  Thus  it becomes easier for those who haven t seen the earlier episodes to catch up while it was on pause  and help boost viewer count   Game of Thrones is expected to air only 73 episodes over the eight seasons  compared to Big Bang Theory s 72 episodes in the past three year period alone  Last but not the least  for the final season  HBO said that the drama will be seen in at least 207 countries and territories  which is expected to generate over one billion viewers across the globe  Stocks to Gain From the GoT Rage As Cersei said that  when you play the  Game of Thrones   you either win or you die  There is no middle ground   Similarly  let us look at stocks that can only win  thanks to this much sorted TV series  Of course  first in the list would be AT T Inc    NYSE T    the parent company of Home Box Office  or HBO  Game of Thrones  success will surely boost AT T s bottom line  After all  the drama series is the most tweeted TV show ever and is breaking record ratings for HBO popular   But  John Stankey  an AT T executive did say that  Game of Thrones is kind of a  once in a decade  or  once in a two decade  kind of moment  The goal is to have a collection of content that keeps the customer permanently engaged    And that s exactly what s happening  HBO s other innovative original television series  including Sex in the City  The Sopranos and Wired  to name a few are also helping its stock gain traction  The Zacks Rank  3  Hold  company has seen its shares gaining 7 2  so far this year  more than the  industry s rise of 5 5    AT T  separately  is poised to gain from the imminent 5G boom and extended LTE coverage  Thus  the Zacks Consensus Estimate for its current year earnings has increased 0 3  over the past 60 days   For the moment  Amazon com  Inc    NASDAQ AMZN    the Seattle based online retailer  offers an array of products including free two day shipping with Amazon Prime  And it s this Amazon Prime that offers content such as Game of Thrones  In fact  they offered the first two seasons at no extra charge  Amazon has already reported a huge earnings beat in the first quarter and its revenues matched expectations  Amazon has been one of the best performing tech stocks so far this year and has outperformed the broader  industry over the past year   22 5  vs   2 4      The Zacks Rank  3 company is  currently  among the top three most valuable companies in the world  The other two are Apple Inc    NASDAQ AAPL   and Microsoft Corporation  NASDAQ MSFT    NYSE T    Nonetheless  the Zacks Consensus Estimate for Amazon s current year earnings has advanced 0 6  over the past 60 days   HBO  in the meantime  has used social media to publicize Game of Thrones and  of course Facebook  Inc    NASDAQ FB   gained immensely by spreading the word that  Winter is Coming   Facebook s official HBO Game of Throne page saw more than 5 million  likes   In fact  Game of Thrones helped Facebook live up to its true purpose  It helped people share similar interests and engage with one another  Facebook  currently  has a Zacks Rank  2  Buy   while the Zacks Consensus Estimate for its current quarter earnings has risen 9 1  over the past 60 days  You can see    While shares of the online social media and social networking service company have gained 8 3  over the past year  the broader  industry more or less remained flat   Radical New Technology Creates  12 3 Trillion Opportunity Imagine buying Microsoft stock in the early days of personal computers  or Motorola  NYSE MSI  after it released the world s first cell phone  These technologies changed our lives and created massive profits for investors  Today  we re on the brink of the next quantum leap in technology  7 innovative companies are leading this  4th Industrial Revolution    and early investors stand to earn the biggest profits 
"T2108 Status  70 2   fourth overbought day VIX Status  11 0General  Short term  Trading Call  Aggressive traders go or stay long  Stop below 1940 on the S P 500Active T2108 periods  Day  242 over 20   Day  94 over 40   Day  21 over 60   Day  4 over 70   overperiod 
Commentary So much for bursting upward into the current overbought period 
Last week I thought T2108 showed every sign of leading the market into an extended overbought rally  Instead  it has spent a third day since then barely resting on the edge of overbought territory  70  or higher   It has teetered while the S P 500 has ever so tentatively nudged higher by inches 

The S P 500 is now running in place  Is it at stall speed or coiling like a spring 


The only thing to do right now is continue waiting for confirmation  I have yet to make a bullish move on the S P 500  ARCA SPY   but I have continued to make more and more aggressive bullish plays on stocks with good technical setups  For some more perspective on why I think the market is more likely to burst to the upside than not  here is a weekly chart for T2108 showing a strong push upward since the lows in June  2013  Notice how each pullback has met higher lows  The wedge like formation demonstrates how more and more stocks have been climbing uptrends and staying there even THROUGH this year s sell off in high multiple and momentum stocks 

T2108 has spent the last year applying ever more pressure upward and outward


If a trader wants to get super technical about this chart  one could argue there is a very slight downtrend on the high side of the wedge  lower highs   However  I think it is a close call  Even if it is there  then T2108 should at least get to 75  or so before ending the current run 
I have four stocks of particular interest today  Rocket Fuel  NASDAQ FUEL   Twitter  NYSE TWTR   Google  NASDAQ GOOG   and Apple  NASDAQ AAPL   note that three of the four are internet plays   probably not an accident   
FUEL gets special recognition as the stock has finally broken out from under its 50DMA downward trend  Regular readers will recall that it was the heavy volume selling in FUEL that alerted me to the possibility that a  cessation in hostilities  could be on the horizon for momentum stocks  At the time  I could not have and did not guess that the run would last THIS long and unfold so steadily persistent  Such bullishness would have paid off handsomely  FUEL has put on a clinic for washing out sellers  high volume trading transferred stock from capitulators to speculators  The over extension below the lower Bollinger Band  BB  was the clincher  I am still long FUEL  Seeing the stock close the post earnings gap down and continue higher makes me even more bullish   the move effectively invalidates whatever FUEL said in the last earnings call that caused so much angst 


A persistent bounce and recovery for FUEL has closed the post earnings gap and then some


TWTR has also had a nice bounce after high volume selling washed out the most ardent sellers from the system  I persisted in making the bullish case for TWTR in several posts as a good play off the bottom as analysts started showing up with upgrades from bearishness to bullishness on the stock  TWTR was a great example of how a change in analyst sentiment CAN help traders  I closed out the last of these trades last week  I think I still want to buy TWTR on dips  It is simply too  expensive  for me to hold much longer at this point and these levels 

TWTR has moved beyond the angst of the lock up expiration


I feel like I have pounded the table for GOOG too much  but I cannot help it  It is rare to see such a bullish setup develop in such slow motion  GOOG has even put on a clinic with two picture perfect retests of 50DMA support  I think GOOG will be off to the races if it closes above the May high soon  around  566 on May 27th   While waiting for the breakout  I have tried playing short term moves with options and some stock  Today s 1 5  display of relative strength was the best move of the bunch  I locked in the profits  a smidgen early as I watched resistance a little too warily   I plan to be even more aggressive on a breakout and likely even bet bullishly on earnings if this display of technical beauty persists that long 

A bull stampeding in slow motion


I end with AAPL  This SHOULD be the crowning moment of bullishness for a bullish overbought period  Alas  AAPL has sagged its way into relative weakness the past two weeks  The palpable explanation is a mild sell the news reaction to the 7 1 stock split  The Apple Trading Model fared very well in the first post split week  It generated only two trades the following week which both failed as the stock essentially floated aimlessly until Friday s drop  Monday also failed to produce  So  I have to put the ATM back on  watch  as I wonder again whether it can remain valid in this post split world  As a reminder  it is very possible I will have to put the model on the shelf until I collect at least several more months of data to compare post and pre split trading behavior 
Now  AAPL seems to be stumbling into another Bollinger Band  BB  squeeze  I think an incredible opportunity is unfolding  A retest of the 50DMA would be an absolute gift in preparation for a likely bull run into October earnings and new product announcements  However  given the strong bullish sentiment in AAPL  I do not think buyers will let AAPL fall that far and thus a fresh BB squeeze SHOULD resolve to the upside  Stay tuned 

AAPL is sagging again  but not for much longer

Don t Fear a Rate Hike  Play Cyclical Sector ETFs

Signs of a recovery in the U S  economy  though not brisk in every area  are surely more than what we saw early this year  Spring sprung improved wage gains  better housing and inflation data  solid retail sales and confidence in the country s citizens 

Though we are yet to see sustained and strong improvement in manufacturing reading and quicker job growth  5  unemployment rate hints at a step up in the economy  Also  the latest Fed minutes  which sparked off the possibility of a June rate hike  give cues of economic well being  An influence on the stock market of this uptick in the economy was only natural 

Yes  the markets have been range bound lately as participants are holding their breath to seep in every bit of Fed related news  Stocks may also slip due to the fear of gradual creases in cheap dollar inflows  But  this hiccup maybe short term in nature  Investors should note that the Fed is tightening policies to reflect a growing economy 

Wealth Effect in Play 

The S P 500 has rallied 2 1  in just the past three days  as of May 26  2016   A  50 oil and a flurry of strong economic data points pulled the index from the trough  If this ascent is maintained  a wealth effect can be realized 

     the wealth effect helps to power economies during bull markets  Big gains in people s portfolios can make them feel more secure about their wealth and their spending  

And in a growing economy  most sectors surge from a wealth effect  with a few of the more cyclical corners making the most of this run up  These industries often sag in a slumping economy  but are the biggest winners when rays of hope are seen 

Cyclicality of Sectors

Cyclical stocks often fall when the economy is tumbling  but are among the biggest winners when the economic environment turns favorable  Among the cyclical ones     sectors like consumer discretionary and financials and economically sensitive sectors like industrials and information technology tend to do better in the early phase of the an economic recovery 

Fidelity defines an early cycle phase when economic activity revives  the policy is still accommodative and sales and profits improve  With the U S  economy fulfilling most of the conditions  we can conclusively say that the coming months will be fairly dominated by the cyclical sectors 

If the Fed hikes rates in the coming month  it should not be more than just 25 bps  This bit of policy tightening should be plausible for cyclical stocks to advance  Moreover  defensive sectors won earlier this year  while cyclical stocks fell behind on higher risk off sentiments  This made the valuation of these cyclical sectors pretty fair  read    

As a result  a few cyclical sectors and related ETFs are expected to perform well ahead  For these investors  we highlight three ETF picks below that have heavy exposure to the cyclical industries 

First Trust Technology AlphaDEX Fund     

The technology sector witnessed a considerable setback this year as the stocks were crushed during the market correction in the initial phase of 2016  If this was not enough  tech behemoth Apple  NASDAQ AAPL  reported its first quarterly revenue drop in 13 years and the first ever decline in iPhone sales sending the sector into a tailspin  Also  downbeat earnings reported by several sector biggies led the sector to fall on hard times  read    

However  the nightmare should soon be over as the sell off looks overdone  So  this technology ETF can be an intriguing bet right now  FXL has a Zacks ETF Rank  1  Strong Buy  with a High risk outlook 

PowerShares KBW Regional Banking Portfolio   

This is yet another laggard of this year  The double whammy of a delay in further Fed rate hike after a liftoff in December and the energy sector slump troubled this sector in the initial phase of 2016  However  talks about the June Fed rate hike amid a growing economy boosted the space lately 

The steepening of the yield curve was a tailwind for banking stocks as these improve banks  net interest margins  This is because the interest rates on deposits are usually tied to short term rates while loans are often tied to long term rates  read     

PowerShares S P SmallCap Consumer Discretionary Portfolio     

A small cap consumer discretionary ETF can be considered a barometer of rising income levels of consumers of an economy  These pint sized stocks do not have much exposure in foreign lands and are thus unaffected by the dollar strength  Moreover  consumer sentiments for May are at a   This makes PSCD an intriguing option to play  The fund has a Zacks ETF Rank  2  Buy  with a Medium risk outlook  read

"The bulk of the Q3 earnings season is now behind us  with results from only 15  of the S P 500 members still awaited  The Retail sector is the only one at this stage that has a sizable number of reports still to come  particularly from the traditional brick and mortar operators like Macy s    and Nordstrom  NYSE JWN     that will report this week  In total  we have almost 650 companies reporting Q3 results  including 31 S P 500 members The picture emerging from the Q3 earnings season is one of overall improvement  particularly on the growth front  Earnings growth for the quarter is on track to be in positive territory  the first positive growth for the S P 500 index after 5 quarters of back to back declines  The  3  earnings growth in Q3  combining the actual results from the 423 index members that have reported already with estimates for the still to come 77 companies  is nevertheless a notable improvement over what we saw in the preceding 5 quarters  as the chart below shows 

As you can see in this chart  positive growth was expected to show up in the last quarter of the year  with pre season expectations putting Q3 growth to be in negative territory  In other words  not only has the earnings recession finally come to an end  but positive growth has arrived ahead of schedule  In a way  Q3 can be seen as an inflection point  with the growth trend shifting from negative to positive In addition to the growth angle  other favorable aspects of the Q3 earnings season pertaining to more numerous positive surprises and only modest negative revisions to Q4 estimates which have become less notable in recent days  Positive surprises are only modestly tracking above other recent periods and estimates for Q4 have started coming down  though the pace of negative revisions still compares favorably with what we had seen in the comparable periods in other recent reporting cycles  The chart below shows how estimates for Q4 have evolved since the start of the quarter 

Q3 Earnings Scorecard  as of 11 04 2016 We now have Q3 results from 423 S P 500 members or 84 6  of the index s total membership that combined account for 87 1  of the index s total market capitalization  Total earnings for these 423 companies are up  3 6  from the same period last year on  2 4  higher revenues  with 72 8  beating EPS estimates and 55 1  coming ahead of revenue estimates The table below shows the scorecard of these 423 index members  The reporting cycle for next week has almost 650 companies reporting results  including 31 S P 500 members  By the end of this week  we will have seen Q3 results from 90 8  of the index s total membership 

This is better performance than we have seen from the same group of 423 index members in other recent periods  as the comparison charts below show 

The Energy sector s growth picture is expected to improve in Q4  but it remains a big drag this earnings season  Excluding the Energy sector  total earnings for the rest index members that have reported are up  7 4  on  4 4  higher revenues The comparison charts below show the aggregated reported picture with and without the Energy sector 

In the comparison chart below  we are comparing the proportion of S P 500 members that are beating both EPS and revenue estimates in Q3 with historical periods  As you can see  Q3 is tracking above other recent periods largely on account of more numerous revenue beats 

Is the Improvement All Finance Driven For the Finance sector  we now have Q3 results from  88 6  of the sector s total market cap in the index  Total earnings for these companies are up  12 7  from the same period last year on  6 7  higher revenues  with 73  beating EPS and an equally high 75 3  beating revenue expectations This is better performance than we have seen from these Finance sector companies in a while  as the below comparison charts show 

Excluding the Finance sector from the aggregate reported picture at this stage  total earnings for the rest of S P 500 members that have reported results will be up  1 2  on  1 7  higher revenues  with 72 8  beating EPS estimates and 49 7  beating revenue estimates The comparison charts below show the aggregate reported growth picture  with and without the Finance sector 

What the above chart shows is that the growth picture becomes less notable without the Finance sector  but it is still an improvement over the recent past Technology Sector s Apple  NASDAQ AAPL  DragFor the Technology sector  we now have Q3 results from 73 8  of the Tech companies in the S P 500 index that combined account for 86 7  of the sector s total market cap in the index  Total earnings for these Tech companies are up  5 0  from the same period last year on  2 5  higher revenues  with 82 2  beating EPS estimates and 75 6  beating revenue expectations The sector s Q3 growth pace is nevertheless an improvement over what we have seen from the same group of Tech stocks over the past year  as the left hand side chart below shows  Positive surprises are also more numerous relative to historical periods  right hand chart  

The Tech sector s growth pace improves even more once Apple s results are excluded from the aggregate picture  Apple s Q3 earnings were down  19  from the same period last year on  9  lower revenues  Excluding Apple  total earnings for the rest of the Tech sector companies that have reported would be up  12 3  from the same period last year on  5 3  higher revenues The comparison charts below show the sector s growth pace with and without the Apple drag  As you can see  the sector s growth picture looks a lot better on an ex Apple basis 

Q3 Expectations As a WholeCombining the actual results from the 423 S P 500 members with estimates from the still to come 77 index members  total Q3 earnings are now expected to be up  3 0  from the same period last year on  1 5  higher revenues  This would compare to 2016 Q2 earnings growth of  2 8  on  0 2  revenues The table below shows the summary picture for Q3 earnings  revenues and margins contrasted with the corresponding results from Q2 

Expectations Beyond Q3The chart below shows current bottom up consensus earnings expectations for the index in 2016 Q3 and the following four quarters contrasted with actual results in the preceding four quarters  Please note that the columns represent bottom up earnings totals for each quarter in billions of dollars while the line represents the quarterly growth rates At the start of the Q3 earnings season  growth was expected to be in negative territory for the 6th quarter in a row  with positive growth expected to resume from Q4   3 7   onwards  But as indicated at the top  growth in Q3 has turned positive already  up  3 0  at present  

The Energy sector drag is expected to end in 2016 Q4 and beyond  as the chart below of the sector s earnings shows 

The improved Energy sector outlook makes sense  given shifting comparisons and the improvement in oil prices  But we will have to wait to find out if estimates for the other sectors will hold up as companies report Q3 results and provide guidance for Q4 and beyond It will be interesting to see if the decelerated pace of negative revisions that we saw the last earnings season will get repeated this time as well

"Global equities fall
US dollar strengthens
End of QE spurs bond selloff
Dollar yield decouples
Key Events
US equity indices all fell yesterday  tumbling the most since the start of 2018  At the same time US Treasuries sold off  pushing yields to their highest levels since April 2014  as the dollar strengthened against all major currencies 
The S P 500 underperformed all major US indices  falling 0 67 percent  the most since September  The Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 0 66 percent  the most since August  The NASDAQ Composite declined 0 51 percent   outperforming  the other major US indices  As well  the Russell 2000 lost 0 59 percent of its value  retreating from its all time high  posted last Wednesday  double the distance down versus its sister US indices 

This morning  global stocks from Japan s TOPIX to Hong Kong s Hang Seng and mainland China s Shanghai Composite  to Australia s S P ASX 200  to Europe s STOXX 600 took their cue from their US counterparts  All sold off 
Greenback  Central Cog of the Market s Structure
German bonds fell yesterday  for a fourth straight day  pushing the 5 year yield into positive territory  as it broke above zero percent for the first time since April 2014  hitting its highest level in more than two years  Investors sharply increased supply and reduced demand after Klaas Knot  the current President of the Dutch central bank and a member of the ECB s Governing Council  said Sunday that quantitative easing has accomplished all it can and therefore should no longer be continued 
Bond investors have been  since last June of a dotcom like crash in the bond market  when the Federal Reserve announced it would gradually begin selling off some of its gargantuan bond portfolio  flooding the market  At the same time it indicated it would begin raising rates  another bond downer  as investors sell their bond holdings in order to buy higher yielding bonds 
While a stock decline generally leads to a Treasury rally  as investors rotated capital out of growth assets into safe havens  bonds have fallen in tandem with stocks  Klaas  comments added to  that central banks worldwide will reduce stimulus as the global economic outlook improves 
Moreover  despite the worst stock slide in four  SPX  to five  Dow  months  safe haven assets fell too  along with all major currencies  The yen fell 0 20 percent while gold slid 0 64 percent 
The highest 10 year yields since April 2014 have attracted a lot of international investors  whose asset purchasing has included buying the dollar  However  the dollar bounce only serves to help bears slam it further and harder  After six straight weekly declines the buck is on track to close the month 3 percent lower as most investors are long euro short dollar 

The dollar is the central cog in the complex market structure  Last week  stocks advanced while the greenback continued to retreat  Yesterday  the USD rose while stocks slipped  Treasuries share a negative correlation with the dollar  as the higher yield increases dollar demand  structuring a dollar yield positive correlation 

That positive correlation has broken down since November  however  when the dollar entered its recent decline and Treasury yields started moving higher  The disconnect may be attributed to a steeper rally in stocks  which sucked up demand  pulling it away from Treasuries which are on the edge of a cliff as QE winds down and higher rates become palpable 
The retreat of Treasuries took benchmark yields above 2 7 percent  but European government bonds edged higher as traders await growth data 
The question investors now struggle with is whether the highest yields since 2014 could turn the capital rotation back out of equities which are already at record setting highs and into bonds  Their decline might provide a buying opportunity at the same time that buy and hold yield investors may boost Treasuries 
An additional example of the dollar s importance to inter market commerce and interconnectivity is the price of oil  When the dollar was falling  oil was rising  Yesterday  however  when the greenback rebounded  crude s price fell 

The yen climbed this morning  trading within a potential bearish pennant  the second one since mid January  Sterling slumped for a second day  its third day decline in four trading days 

Bitcoin dropped below  11 000  resuming its bearish pennant pattern  It s not the only cryptocurrency currently in focus for many investors  A brewing Tether scandal has generated headlines too

" Thursday Market Close 
The market is taking investors on a wild ride this week  and Thursday might have been even more turbulent than Wednesday 
Wednesday was pretty much straight down  but Thursday was all over the place  At one point  the Dow Jones Industrial Average   DJI  was off by more than 700 points and then clawed back 300 points within a half an hour before sliding again  At another point  the  DJI slid under 25 000 and fell to its lowest level since mid July  The S P 500  SPX  ended down about 2  for the day  and off 6  for the week to date 
Relationships between stock market sectors and outside influencers like Treasury yields seem out of sync  Some of the stocks that took the worst beating on Wednesday  like tech  held in there while some of Wednesday s better performers  like utilities  got whacked 
Meanwhile  volatility continued to spin higher  though not at the same dizzying rate as the day before  By late in the session  the market s  fear index   the VIX  was up 8   near 25  It was under 12 as recently as Oct  2 
Easy Does It
All this sends a distinct message to anyone trying to trade these markets  Don t get trapped  If you re an experienced trader moving in and out of these bumps and bruises like a skier cruising the moguls  good for you  But for many of us  these are the kind of markets where you don t want to go all in or all out  Though it admittedly can increase your trading costs  consider trading small if you feel the need to trade at all  That might mean dividing your investment unit into smaller chunks  and not committing too much to any trade at any one time  Moving in partial increments can sometimes help you make better decisions 
At this point  even some of the experts are having trouble getting their arms around all of this volatility  so it s important for long term investors not to let themselves get frustrated  The ground is vibrating under the market  and it might be hard to decide what to do next  As noted earlier today  it looks like some sector shakeouts might be under way  and it s hard to say where things might settle 
Here s Looking at the Positives
While there s no clear sign of any major reversal shaping up in the near term  there were some developments Thursday that at least looked more constructive 
First of all  the info tech sector held together a bit better than on Wednesday  when it looked like a rush for the exits  Both info tech and communication services  the new sector that has some stocks that used to hang out in tech  were among the best performers Thursday  The day before  there seemed to be a theme around selling some of the big tech names like Facebook  NASDAQ FB   Netflix  NASDAQ NFLX   and Apple  NASDAQ AAPL  that had taken the market up so much into October  On Thursday  however  it wasn t quite as big a bloodbath  There was less selling of the market cap heavy big names  Is this something investors can hang their hats on  Some analysts will say it s just a dead cat bounce  and probably it s important to see a couple more days of tech coming back before it looks meaningful 
Another development that began late Wednesday and carried into Thursday was a fledgling rally in beaten down Treasury bonds  One challenge for investors as stocks fell this week was seeing bonds fall as well and not knowing where to put their money  The slight rise in Treasuries  with a corresponding drop in the 10 year yield to 3 14  by late Thursday afternoon  could help ease some minds  potentially 
Also  chances of a fourth Fed rate hike began to slip this week and now stands at 74   according to Fed funds futures  That s still pretty high  but down from above 80  a week ago 
As rate hike odds decline and yields slip  it s a bit odd to see the utilities come under pressure  but that s what happened Thursday  People had been buying utilities as yields went up  which is opposite of the typical historic pattern  It s arguably another sign of the topsy turvy situation on Wall Street right now 
The financials had risen earlier this week with rates  but began losing ground late Wednesday and continued to crater on Thursday  Perhaps it s another sign of investors feeling like they ve been burned on financials a number of times this year when rates looked like they might move higher only to reverse themselves 
Bank Earnings Move Into Spotlight Friday
Financials will likely be in focus early Friday as three of the biggest banks report  One thing investors might want to listen for is thoughts from JP Morgan Chairman and CEO Jamie Dimon  who usually speaks during the company s earnings call  His remarks can sometimes shed light on how he sees the economy shaping up 
Things aren t shaping up well from a technical standpoint  seemingly  The S P 500 broke below its 200 day moving average of around 2765 pretty aggressively Thursday  Some analysts had seen that level as one that might bring support  and one that had held pretty well earlier this year  Now we ll see if the market can find its way back without that particular support point to help prop it up 
A heavy percentage of SPX stocks are now in correction mode  meaning down 10  or more from recent highs  That still isn t the case for the SPX itself  however  After Thursday s 2 1  drop  the SPX is down 7  from its late September all time high  It would need to fall to around 2650  down from the current 2728  to officially enter a correction for the second time this year 
The same can t be said for the NASDAQ  It entered correction territory intraday Thursday  down more than 10  from its recent high of approximately 8133  It closed down just over 1  Thursday at 7329 
Amid the stock and Treasury market fluctuations  both oil and the U S  dollar moved lower Thursday  potentially positive developments for the stock market  Crude is back toward the  70 a barrel level  down from the mid  70 s earlier this week  The dollar index is back around 95 after briefly moving above 96 a few days ago  The weaker crude market helped drag energy shares Thursday  but might have helped some other companies including airlines 
With bank earnings kicking things off Friday  the market is setting up for perhaps another day of choppy action  so keep the seatbelts fashioned and remember to consider making caution a watchword 
 
FIGURE 1  VIX Back in Force  The VIX  which measures volatility  rose to a high near 29 on Thursday  a huge swing from lows early this month below 12  This would seem to indicate that many investors expect continued choppiness ahead

"The pharma and biotech stocks kicked off 2018 on a strong note  carrying on the momentum gained last year  Though the sector has been struggling lately  probably on broader market pressure  it is expected to rebound as the year progresses 
Innovation  mergers and acquisitions  M As   strong results  product approvals and positive data flow should act as catalysts for pharma and biotech stocks 
M As to Accelerate 
Last year was not particularly great as far as M A deals were concerned  Industry bellwether Johnson   Johnson  NYSE JNJ  acquired Actelion for approximately  30 billion  while Gilead acquired Kite for  11 9 billion  
However  this year  expectations of an increase in M A activity are high  The new tax law  which cuts the corporate tax rate from 35  to 21  and encourages companies to bring back cash held overseas at a one time tax rate of 10   is expected to spur merger activity  Sanofi  PA SASY   SNY  and Celgene  CELG  have already announced two deals each so far this year 
Sanofi announced deals to buy Belgian biotech company Ablynx and hemophilia focused biotech Bioverativ  BIVV   Celgene announced deals to buy Juno Therapeutics  Inc   JUNO   which focuses on the development of CAR T therapies  and Impact Biomedicines  which will add a late stage JAK2 kinase inhibitor  to Celgene s pipeline 
Merck  MRK  recently announced that it has proposed to buy Australian oncolytic immunotherapies maker Viralytics Ltd  to strengthen its presence in the fast growing immuno oncology market  
While some of these companies are looking to replace sales of blockbuster products that are facing loss of patent exclusivity  others are looking to build their pipelines both through acquisitions as well as licensing agreements 
Companies with innovative technologies and pipelines are highly sought after  Niche disease areas like nonalcoholic steatohepatitis  NASH   immuno oncology and multiple sclerosis are in demand  Treatments for orphan diseases are also much sought after  with quite a few deals being signed in these areas  With the Gilead  GILD     Kite and Celgene    Juno acquisitions and the approval of the two CAR T therapies in the United States last year   Novartis   NVS  Kymriah and Gilead s Yescarta    interest in immuno oncology has picked up significantly 
Innovative Pipelines
Pharma and biotech companies continue to work on bringing innovative treatments to market  There could be significant catalysts in the coming quarters in the form of important new product approvals as well as major data read outs  especially in key therapeutic areas like immuno oncology  Alzheimer s  central nervous system disorders and immunology inflammation 
Cancer Remains a Key Therapeutic Area
Although several new treatments have emerged in the field of cancer  interest in this area remains high with the disease being one of the leading causes of morbidity and mortality across the world  Even though a lot of progress has been made in this area  companies are aiming to bring out newer and better treatments  Focus in this area has increased with the recent FDA approval of CAR T therapies Kymriah and Yescarta 
The approval of Kymriah and Yescarta marks the beginning of a new era in the treatment of cancer  The path breaking immunocellular therapy is a one time treatment that uses a patient s own T cells to fight cancer  The acquisition of Kite by Gilead and the potential acquisition of Juno by Celgene have led to renewed interest in this area 
Major players in this field include Bristol Myers  Novartis  AstraZeneca  Merck and Roche 
Immuno oncology deals are being inked by companies like Pfizer  PFE   Celgene  Merck KGaA  Bristol Myers  BMY   AstraZeneca  AZN   AbbVie  ABBV  and Incyte  INCY   Interest in PARP inhibitors has also increased considerably as they could well be the next major class of therapeutics in oncology 
According to IMSQuintiles  68 new cancer drugs were approved for 22 indications from 2011 to 2016  Worldwide costs for cancer therapeutics and supportive care drugs shot up from  91 billion in 2012 to  113 billion in 2016 with the United States accounting for 46  of the costs  More than 600 molecules are in late stage development  with the majority being targeted therapy 
New Product Sales Should Ramp Up
Sales of products that have gained approval over the last two years  as well as line and usage extensions  should boost growth  Recent entrants like Novartis  psoriasis treatment Cosentyx  Merck s PD 1 inhibitor  Keytruda and Pfizer s cancer treatment Ibrance have already achieved blockbuster status and are key contributors to the top line  Meanwhile  cancer treatments like Lynparza  Kyprolis  Keytruda  Opdivo and Imbruvica should also bring in more sales thanks to label expansions 
Higher Number of Drugs Approved in 2017
In 2017  the FDA granted approval to 46 novel drugs  more than double of last year s total tally of 22  Key approvals this year include  Novartis s Kymriah  the first gene therapy in the United States   Lilly s Verzenio  advanced or metastatic breast cancer   Gilead s Vosevi  hepatitis C virus   Puma s Nerlynx  to reduce the risk of breast cancer returning   J J s Tremfya  moderate to severe plaque psoriasis   Regeneron Sanofi s Kevzara  rheumatoid arthritis   Roche s multiple sclerosis treatment  Ocrevus  Regeneron and Sanofi s eczema treatment  Dupixent  TESARO s PARP inhibitor  Zejula  BioMarin s Brineura  treatment of a specific form of Batten disease   AbbVie s Mavyret  HCV  and Gilead s Yescarta among others  Quite a few of these drugs have blockbuster potential 
Some of the key drugs currently under FDA review with decisions expected in a couple of months include Teva s fremanezumab  migraine   Amgen s Aimovig  prevention of migraine   J J s apalutamide  pre metastatic prostate cancer  and AbbVie s elagolix  endometriosis with associated pain   
Meanwhile  the agency is working on streamlining the development process for drugs for rare diseases as well as targeted cancer therapies  Earlier this month  the FDA proposed new guidelines  which are aimed at lowering the clinical study goals of treatments being developed for neurological disorders such as muscular dystrophies  amyotrophic lateral sclerosis  ALS   Alzheimer s disease  AD   migraine and epilepsy that aren t adequately addressed by available therapies  The FDA is also working on clearing up a backlog of orphan drug applications 
According to the IMSQuintiles report  the late phase R D pipeline for the industry indicates that there should be about 40 45 new brand launches every year through 2021 
Tech Tie Ups to Pick Up Pace
The Internet of Medical Things  IoMT  could well be the future of healthcare as pharma companies look to innovate and keep up with technology to help patients and physicians better monitor and track diseases 
IoMT involves the bringing together of technology and medical devices and applications  Chronic diseases  which require frequent monitoring  can be tracked effectively so that patients receive timely and proper treatment  Wearable devices like Apple  NASDAQ AAPL  Watch  Fitbit and Samsung  KS 005930  S Health help users achieve their fitness and health targets 
Pharma and tech companies are now taking things a step further and collaborating to make devices that can track chronic and lifestyle associated diseases like diabetes  which are becoming rampant 
In fact  the scope for innovation in this area    contact lenses that can detect glucose levels  devices that monitor caloric intake  bioelectronic medicines that may treat a wide range of chronic diseases  robotic assisted surgery   is seemingly endless 
Stock Picks
Although the sector may face some volatility due to the drug pricing issue  pipeline success in innovative and important therapeutic areas  cost cutting  share buybacks  new products  increased pipeline visibility and appropriate utilization of cash should help maintain investor confidence in this sector 
Companies like Pfizer  AbbVie  Novo Nordisk  CO NOVOb   NVO   Regeneron Pharmaceuticals  Inc   REGN   Zoetis  Inc   ZTS   Bioverativ  Amphastar Pharmaceuticals  Inc   AMPH   Horizon Pharma Public Ltd  Co   HZNP   Summit Therapeutics plc  SMMT   Gemphire Therapeutics Inc   GEMP  etc  are all Buy ranked stocks  While Regeneron and Bioverativ are Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  stocks  others carry a Zacks Rank  2  Buy

Conclusion
All said and done  the pharma sector s fundamentals remain strong    robust pipelines  innovative treatments  impressive results  growing demand for drugs  especially for rare diseases   an aging population and increased health care spending should support growth  To know more about this sector  check out our latest  "
"In the current unstable financial climate  the need to reduce one s susceptibility against changing economic fortunes has become a top priority for investors  This is where the safe haven appeal of gold becomes alluring and often acts as a cushion to fall back on  In contrast to more volatile stock market investments  gold has always been valued as a solid and dependable means to protect wealth 
There are plenty of reasons to be optimistic about the gold mining industry for both the short and long term  Below  we have discussed what investors in the gold mining sector can look forward to in the coming months and years 
Asia Continues as a Catalyst
In the last decade  combined demand for gold from India and China has soared 71   These two markets roughly account for 54  of consumer gold demand  Asia is now less economically dependent on the West and has displayed relatively strong growth since the global financial crisis  despite persistently weak growth in the United States and Europe 
India s gold industry suffered a setback last year due to the imposition of Goods and Services Tax  GST   The market is anticipated to bounce back as it adapts to GST  Moreover  government measures like mandatory hallmarking in 2018 is likely to be a positive for the industry  Pent up demand as well as festive buying is expected to bolster demand for jewelry in the country 
India has a strong tradition of investing in gold  primarily in jewelry  Demand mostly increases around the wedding and festive seasons  which begin from mid to late August and continue until January  Expenditure on gold can account for almost 30  of the total wedding cost  This gives a boost to local currency demand and raises gold prices 
Further  the Indian government s plans to formulate a comprehensive policy to develop gold as an asset class is likely to positively impact the gold industry  Moreover  the Union Budget includes policies designed to boost rural incomes  which is a major gold consumer  Demand will grow year over year  given the insatiable appetite for gold and the rising wealth of Indian consumers 
In China  people view gold  whether in the form of bars  coins or jewelry  as a natural medium for savings and diversification  Gold is embedded in China s culture  and the Chinese New Year and weddings are key events for the country s gold consumption 
Lately  it has been observed that 18 carat Gold and 3D hard gold jewelry continued to gain market share in China as consumers are increasingly tempted by the innovative  fashionable  non traditional designs offered in these categories  The jewelry trade is now focusing more on branding and customer service  It is expecting a recovery in jewelry demand in 2018 
The expanding middle class in China and India  combined with broader economic growth  will have a significant impact on gold demand  In Asian economies  gold demand is generally closely correlated to increasing wealth and consequently will continue to sustain demand in the years to come 
Improving Employment Levels in U S  Markets Hold Promise
The United States delivered the strongest first quarter in the last nine years driven by economic growth  improving employment levels and growth in consumer confidence  Also  online sales continue to be robust  a trend that is expected to continue 
Innovation in Technology Boosts Demand for Gold
Technology demand was pegged at 82 tons in the first quarter of 2018  4  higher year over year and marked the sixth consecutive quarter of growth 
Lately demand for gold is increasing in electronics  from bonding wire to LEDs and Printed Circuit Boards  PCBs   LED demand continues to recover  showing improvement in the automotive sector  where LEDs are used extensively in sensor technology  New features  such as collision avoidance and intelligent sensing  depend on state of the art sensor chips containing gold  Further  industry upgrade to Organic LED lighting given its versatility and energy saving benefits will boost gold demand and could help offset the switch to gold free Chip Scale Packaging  CSP  seen in the sector 
PCBs  which enjoyed positive spill over benefits from strong smartphone shipments  continued to benefit from increasingly widespread adoption of wireless charging  The wireless sector remained strong on demand from leading smartphone manufacturers for new models 
Research continues on finding new uses of gold in applications  Researchers in the United States and China have developed a gold based catalyst that could improve the performance and efficiency of hydrogen powered cars 
The wireless sector is driving major demand  It has become key area of growth as facial recognition is increasingly deployed in smartphones  gaming consoles and security systems  The 5G network upgrades currently in progress within the telecommunications industry will be a growth driver  going ahead  Verizon plans to roll out 5G to five cities in the United States  In fact  China  Japan  Taiwan and South Korea have similar plans 
Moreover  gold is finding use in the health sector as well  with researchers developing an artificial retina made of organic ink and gold while gold nanoparticles are being used to treat cancer and help diagnose other diseases 
Gold s Safe Haven Appeal
Gold has always been viewed as a metal of great value and a safe haven asset  The buying of gold is a hedge against inflation  macroeconomic  geopolitical  systemic and monetary risk  This trend intensifies during periods of economic turmoil and geopolitical tensions  The current economic scenario is rife with all these factors 
Superiority Over Other Precious Metals
Gold s worldwide acceptance as a medium of value sets it apart from other precious metals such as platinum  palladium and silver whose demand stems mainly from industrial applications  The yellow metal is produced primarily for accumulation while the other commodities are produced for consumption 
Moreover  in contrast to other commodities  gold does not perish  tarnish or corrode  nor does it have quality grades  There has not been any material change in gold s quality over the years  gold mined thousands of years ago is the same as today  Gold existing above ground is easily interchanged with newly mined gold  This ensures the continuous demand of the metal for years to come

The Best Stocks of the 10 Year Bull Market
It has been 10 years since the U S  stock market touched its post financial crisis nadir on Mar 9  2009  Since then  American stocks have gained despite concerns about global economic growth  anxieties related to central bank policies and tit for tat trade war threats  Having said that  the United States and China s initiative to reach a deal  stabilize interest rates and an uptick in consumer confidence have surely provided the required impetus to stocks 
The current bull run has lifted both the S P 500 and the Dow Jones index by more than 400   Since the financial crisis  increase in share prices and dividends helped the broader S P 500  in particular  add nearly  21 trillion to its value  per the S P Dow Jones Indices 
In the meantime  the tech laden Nasdaq has risen more than 500   mostly led by fast growing tech bigwigs including the FAANGs  For instance  Apple  NASDAQ AAPL  has given its shareholders a 1 373 7  return since the financial crisis  while Netflix  NASDAQ NFLX  returned 6 396 7   In other words  if you had bought  100 000 in Netflix stock on Mar 9  2009  you would have been a millionaire by now

"We re only halfway through the month  but so far the old trading adage  Sell in May and go away  seems a little premature  Last Thursday  the S P 500 Index closed at new consecutive record highs  topping the previous record set on April 24 and further extending the six year bull run  The surge came on the heels of weaker economic data last week  leading investors to believe that the Federal Reserve will refrain from raising interest rates this summer  if not this year  All 10 sectors ended Thursday s session in the black  with technology leading the rally  Apple  NASDAQ AAPL  and Facebook  NASDAQ FB  made the widest gains  Friday s close came within just a few points of another new high  suggesting that a top has not yet been reached but that instead the market is looking to break out  Dividend Growth at 15 Percent With a little over 90 percent of S P 500 companies having reported  average first quarter earnings for the index rose a modest 2 percent  That might not seem significant  but as LP Financial s Chief Investment Officer Burt White points out in a recent Barron s piece   given the steep uphill climb that corporate America faced due to the twin drags of the oil downturn and strong U S  dollar  this is actually a good result   Indeed  when the earnings season began  economists were expecting to see a 3 percent drop because of depressed oil and the strong dollar  Of course  we re now seeing a price reversal in both the commodity and currency  Dividends from S P 500 companies also rose  jumping about 15 percent in the first quarter  defying lackluster estimates  Delta Air Lines  NYSE DAL  announced this week that it would be raising its dividend 50 percent as well as buying back  5 billion in stock over the next couple of years  What s important for investors to recognize here is that the S P 500 dividend yield is currently at 1 92 percent  ahead of the 1 50 percent yield on a 5 year government bond  And unlike the government bonds  equities give you potential growth  
Investors Shrug Off Weak Economic NewsThe week s economic data suggests that the U S  economy is growing at a slower rate now than in previous months  According to the U S  Census Bureau  retail and food service sales in April were little changed from March  Inventories are steadily creeping up  On Friday  economists trimmed their forecast for the rate of jobs growth this year from 3 2 percent to 2 4 percent  Meanwhile  the University of Michigan consumer confidence index fell pretty dramatically from 95 9 in April to 88 6 in May  This soft economic news appears not to have dampened investors  spirits too much  however  as it means the Fed will be more likely to keep rates low for at least the short term  You can see that the M1 money supply  the most liquid form of capital  began to ramp up with the first round of quantitative easing  QE  in late 2008  pulling the S P 500 up with it  We called the bottom of the market in December 2008  After three cycles  QE officially wrapped up last October  but money continues to flow into the market  lifting all boats  Lately  investors have been moving more of their money out of domestic equity funds and into internationally focused funds  especially those focused on Europe  according to a Credit Suisse  report  This is in line with the results of a  I shared earlier in the month which shows that global investors are most bullish on the eurozone than any other region Significant Inverse Relationship Between the U S  Dollar and Gold Oil The U S  dollar lost more ground for the fifth straight week  falling to its lowest level since January  This has allowed crude oil to begin its recovery it s currently trading just below  60 per barrel while gold marks time in the  1 200 range  As you can see  the dollar reverted back to its mean after rising to close to three standard deviations as recently as mid March  There s plenty of momentum for the dollar to drop even further  which should help oil s recovery  Gold remains in a three year bear market  In an interview with Jim Puplava on the  I explained that the domestic equity bull market has lately overshadowed the yellow metal as an asset class  but that when gold s down  as it is now  it might be time to put money in gold and gold stocks  This week we expect to see preliminary purchasing manager s index  PMI  numbers for not only the U S  and Europe but also China  Perhaps we ll see if the U S  economy has really softened or if it s simply taking a breather after months of steady growth  Disclaimer  Stock markets can be volatile and share prices can fluctuate in response to sector related and other risks as described in the fund prospectus  Foreign and emerging market investing involves special risks such as currency fluctuation and less public disclosure  as well as economic and political risk  By investing in a specific geographic region  a regional fund s returns and share price may be more volatile than those of a less concentrated portfolio  The Emerging Europe Fund invests more than 25  of its investments in companies principally engaged in the oil   gas or banking industries  The risk of concentrating investments in this group of industries will make the fund more susceptible to risk in these industries than funds which do not concentrate their investments in an industry and may make the fund s performance more volatile  M1 Money Supply includes funds that are readily accessible for spending  Standard deviation is a measure of the dispersion of a set of data from its mean  The more spread apart the data  the higher the deviation  Standard deviation is also known as historical volatility  The Purchasing Manager s Index is an indicator of the economic health of the manufacturing sector  The PMI index is based on five major

For Immediate ReleaseChicago  IL   October 22  2019   Zacks com announces the list of stocks featured in the Analyst Blog  Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets  Stocks recently featured in the blog include  MDU Resources Group  Inc    NYSE MDU    AquaVenture Holdings Ltd    NYSE WAAS    Tenet Healthcare Corp    NYSE THC    US Foods Holding Corp    NYSE USFD   and Genesis Healthcare  Inc    NYSE GEN   Here are highlights from Monday s Analyst Blog  5 Safe Stocks to Counter IMF s Dull Global Economic OutlookThe International Monetary Fund  IMF  has shown pessimism on World Economic Outlook  WEO   downgrading the global growth rate and warning policymakers to watch their step before taking any decision On the other end  the world s economic giants  the United States and China are paying the price for the long lasting trade war  China s GDP  in particular  declined to the lowest level in last three decades  while manufacturing sectors in both the United States and China slowed down Investors should thus purchase safer defensive stocks to keep their portfolio guarded in such an economic upheaval IMF s World Economic Outlook Shaves GrowthPer an Oct 15 report  IMF expects global growth to be 3  in 2019  lower than last year s growth of 3 6   It is a 0 3  cut from its April s forecast  IMF s chief economist  Gita Gopinath focused on higher import tariffs that are impacting manufacturing activities and international trade In fact  IMF warned the world s central banks that they are  wasting scarce ammunition  as an attempt to compensate for  policy blunders  leaving global economy at its weakest since the last recession  If world economic growth slows to below the 2 5  rate  it would indicate a recession The forecast for 2020 was also reduced from 3 6  to 3 4   IMF also mentioned that if the U S  China trade war continues  global growth will reduce another 0 8  by 2020 The persistent trade war  by the way  has already impacted China s economic growth  And now a downward revision for growth has also been made for the Singapore  Hong Kong and South Korea China s Growth Slows Down at 6  RateChina s economic growth slowed down at a 6  rate in the third quarter  its lowest since 1992 as a result of deteriorating business activities  Though this quarter reported recovery in sectors like industrial output and retail  there was only a 5 4  rise in investment in fixed assets  a major economic driver  In spite of China s immense efforts to support the economy  by cutting taxes  the country is struggling to overcome the impacts of the trade war with the United States and a poor domestic demand  With the  phase one  deal still remaining unsigned and fresh trouble emerging from Hong Kong  it is unsure if conditions will improve any time soon Weak U S  Economic Data Triggers TensionOn the other side of the Pacific  economic data reported in the first half of October is leading to signs of a slowdown and creating panic among investors  U S  retail sales fell 0 3  in September  as per government reports  Consumers have been the strength of the U S  economy but this first time drop in retail sales in seven months clearly indicates that trade war fears are restraining them from spending Further  September s Institute for Supply Management s  ISM  manufacturing index slipped to 47 8   its lowest level since June 2009  The decline in manufacturing activities has been strongly impacted by sluggish exports and disruption in supply chain  thanks to the U S China trade war All these factors point toward a slowdown in the U S  economy as well 5 Stocks to Buy Markets are turning volatile due to the aforesaid factors  So  defensive stocks that have give a stable performance in any market gyration are investors  best hope to guard their portfolio now Stocks like utilities  consumer staples and healthcare are considered defensive as they have stable earnings regardless of market condition  the fact that these products or services are of basic necessity  keeps them in consistent demand irrespective of the business We have thus shortlisted

"Facebook   NASDAQ FB   expects its Libra to launch in the first half of 2020  Libra is a global digital currency that can be used to make payments on Facebook and WhatsApp and will be contained in its digital wallet called Calibra that will also be launched soon  Calibra is also a subsidiary company based in Switzerland that will develop products and services based on Libra  oh why doesn t that inspire confidence     Facebook hopes that other companies will build their own wallets atop the Libra network and its currency will eventually be used more broadly 
The company s focus seems to be on underdeveloped economies and the  unbanked  although it will be interesting to see what companies organizations it intends to partner with in these regions  because this group will typically not be booking Ubers or buying sandwiches  The inability to bring value will actually make it a hard sell in these regions  especially because it will disrupt local players and reduce the government s regulatory control over the banking system  particularly because of Facebook s disregard for regulatory requirements  the company broadly tested WhatsApp payments in India without required approvals and didn t say it would be stopping in July until it was required to appear before the apex court  
There are other regulatory problems  as well  Libra for instance will facilitate payments between individuals irrespective of whether they are criminals or not and irrespective of whether there are sanctions on them or not  as in Iran s case at the moment   Facebook needs to offer very good proof that it won t facilitate terrorism  This will be very hard to do considering the way it handles the social network 
The currency will be controlled and transactions vetted by a non profit called the Libra Association operating out of Switzerland  a low tax or no tax zone   So users have to trust this group to grant necessary permissions and maintain proper records and balances  Facebook s list of partners numbers 17 right now  and doesn t include banks  But the company plans to change all that 
At launch  it will have    according to David Marcus  the man behind the initiative at Facebook    100 partners including banks  those which stand to lose the most from all of this  And Facebook  which will gain the most from the initiative by virtue of its network  will have a single vote and so will be able to say that it alone isn t responsible for any problems with Libra 
It s hard to figure out what theory Facebook will peddle to banks about how good this will be for them  or if it will simply say that they can t afford to not be a part of this  given Facebook s reach and the success of WeChat s competing model for payments within the chat app in China 
While the currency will literally remove a lot of middlemen  banks   it still needs to have banks in the loop because every time people want to use Libra  they have to convert cash into the digital currency  And if it wants to target the  500 billion dollar remittances market  there also needs to be a smooth process to convert Libra back to local currency  These are areas where banks will be needed 
In exchange  banks will be giving up fees for processing credit card transactions  credit cards are relatively low in number in developing countries and come with collection hassles  as everywhere else   They will also be giving up direct contact with customers and the ability to collect data on them  They will  however  be making way for a company with mountains of information on the people being targeted  something the banks don t have today anyway  So in a way  they will be able to make money from people that were earlier inaccessible to them 
So Facebook can t do this on its own  without banks  It also needs banks because they are better trusted by people in general 
Reactions
Chris Hughes  a co founder of Facebook  has warned that Libra could shift power into the wrong hands   If even modestly successful  Libra would hand over much of the control of monetary policy from central banks to these private companies  If global regulators don t act now  it could very soon be too late  
The Bank for International Settlements  BIS  is concerned about reduction in competition  data privacy and destabilization of the banking system that has barely recovered from the 2008 crash   The aim should be to respond to big techs  entry into financial services so as to benefit from the gains while limiting the risks   said Hyun Song Shin  economic adviser and head of research at BIS   Public policy needs to build on a more comprehensive approach that draws on financial regulation  competition policy and data privacy regulation  
Democratic Rep  Maxine Waters  chair of the House Financial Services Committee said   Given the company s troubled past  I am requesting that Facebook agree to a moratorium on any movement forward on developing a cryptocurrency until Congress and regulators have the opportunity to examine these issues and take action  
Democrat senator Sherrod Brown tweeted   Facebook is already too big and too powerful  and it has used that power to exploit users  data without protecting their privacy  We cannot allow Facebook to run a risky new cryptocurrency out of a Swiss bank account without oversight  
Republican Patrick McHenry said   While there is great promise for this new technology in fostering financial inclusion and faster payments  particularly in the developing world  we know there are many open questions as to the scope and scale of the project and how it will conform to our global financial regulatory framework  We need to go beyond the rumors and speculations and provide a forum to assess this project and its potential unprecedented impact on the financial system  
Bloomberg reports that the French Finance Minister  Bruno Le Maire  has already asked the group of seven central bank governors to  prepare a report on Facebook s project  especially with respect to privacy  money laundering and terrorism finance 
Markus Ferber  a German member of the European Parliament  has drawn the attention of regulators to Facebook s attempt to become a  shadow bank  
Conclusion
No matter what anyone says  investors like this move  For once  Facebook has shown them a strong alternative revenue source that will allow it to diversify beyond ads  If banks jump on board  it will be a huge validation of its technology and strategy to remain the biggest monopoly ever and make really big bucks while at it  As long as governments allow it that is 

Facebook shares carry a Zacks Rank  2  Buy   Better stocks in the sector are Autohome   NYSE ATHM    Marchex   NASDAQ MCHX    Match Group   NASDAQ MTCH    The Trade Desk   NASDAQ TTD   to name a few  For broader exposure  check out the complete list of today s Zacks  1 Rank  Strong Buy  stocks here

It could become the mother of all technological revolutions  Apple  NASDAQ AAPL  sold a mere 1 billion iPhones in 10 years but a new breakthrough is expected to generate more than 27 billion devices in just 3 years  creating a  1 7 trillion market 
Zacks has just released a Special Report that spotlights this fast emerging phenomenon and 6 tickers for taking advantage of it  If you don t buy now  you may kick yourself in 2020 "
"President Trump recently claimed that China has broken the trade deal  while Chinese officials threatened to retaliate if Washington imposes additional tariffs on Chinese imports  Such warnings about counter measures roiled markets  In such a murky scenario  U S  manufacturing companies that have significant business in China are likely to feel the impact  but not service providers as they aren t on the forefront to bear the tariff brunt 
Therefore  at present  investing in service firms could be beneficial for investors 
Fresh US China Trade Tensions
Global equity markets took a dip following Trump s threat this weekend to escalate tariffs on  200 billion of Chinese goods  The president s tweets came right ahead of a vital week of negotiations that could have possibly put an end to the months long trade war between the United States and China  Trade negotiations are currently ongoing in Washington DC 
If Trump follows through with his resolution  tariffs on  200 billion worth of Chinese products could soon be raised from the current 10  to 25  beginning midnight  May 10  But what stands to rattle the financial markets further is China s resolution to fight back  Beijing has already signaled that it would retaliate in kind 
This would mean that American companies that largely operate in China are likely to be affected as Chinese tariffs take effect on their products 
Invest in Sectors With Less Exposure to Trade Policy 
In such a scenario  it makes sense to minimize investments in U S  goods companies that have more exposure to international trade policies and instead invest in services companies that have more domestic operations 
According to a Goldman Sachs  NYSE GS  report   Services stocks have less foreign input costs that might be subject to tariffs and are also less exposed to potential trade retaliation given they have less non U S  sales exposure than Goods companies  Services stocks have faster sales and earnings growth  more stable gross margins  and stronger balance sheets  
In addition  services companies have better sales and earnings growth  Such firms also have stronger balance sheets and gross margins that are more stable  the investment bank noted 
For example  services companies such as Google  NASDAQ GOOGL   Amazon  NASDAQ AMZN  and Wells Fargo  NYSE WFC  have lesser foreign input costs exposed to tariffs and should therefore outperform  On the other hand  goods companies like Apple  NASDAQ AAPL   which suffered greatly in fourth quarter 2018 due to low iPhone demand in China  could witness the cycle being repeated 
In fact  business services have been faring better than the manufacturing sector  which is evident from April s impressive jobs report 
Business Services Created Most New Jobs in April
Professional and business services took the center stage in April s strong jobs gains  According to the Labor department  the sector added a whopping 76 000 new jobs last month  outshining manufacturing by far and large  which merely added 4000 new jobs 
The annualized job additions of these sectors have a significant difference as well  Business services added more than twice as many jobs as manufacturing  with the former adding 535 000 jobs over the past 12 months while the latter added only an average of 22 000 jobs a month in the same time frame 
The stark difference in new positions created indicates rapid growth in the business services sector  which again  marks it ideal for investments right now

" Wednesday Market Open  After waiting for the latest U S  inflation data  the market rose slightly in premarket trading as the headline consumer price index rose 0 3  in October  in line with Briefing com consensus forecasts  but slowed to 2 5  on a yearly basis 
While that might not be enough to alter the Federal Reserve s current track of gradually increasing interest rates  it likely doesn t do anything to increase the market s fear that the central bank might become more hawkish and end up tightening monetary policy more quickly 
Ringing Up Sales Ahead Of The Holidays
Another bright spot this morning came as a present from Macy s  NYSE M   which reported earnings per share that handily beat expectations on revenue that was slightly stronger than analysts had forecast  in the latest positive sign for the company s turnaround story  It s another retailer that has beaten projections after Home Depot  NYSE HD  also beat on top and bottom lines 
Ahead of the holiday season all important for retailers data have been showing that the American consumer seems to be doing well amid a strong economy and tight jobs market  Tomorrow morning  government data are scheduled to give a fresh reading on retail sales  This number may be a good one to watch as retailers report earnings 
Walmart  NYSE WMT  is scheduled to report Q3 earnings for fiscal 2019 tomorrow before the market opens  For Q3  WMT is expected to report adjusted EPS of  1 01 on revenue of  125 45 billion  according to third party consensus analyst estimates 
Across the pond  Britain and the European Union have agreed on a draft of a Brexit deal  It s a positive step in one of the geopolitical uncertainties that seem to have been weighing on the market  but it remains to be seen what Britain s final exit of the trade bloc will look like 
Oil s Slide Stops   For Moment
Although equities futures were pointing to a higher open this morning  the market could continue its back and forth trading as investors look for news on the U S  China trade front and monitor developments in the oil market  which this morning seems to be trying to put in a bottom after precipitous declines 
Yesterday  worries about global growth mixed with concerns about oversupply seemed to keep oil prices under sharp pressure  U S  crude fell more than 7  while its international counterpart dipped more than 6  
Both have been sliding as investors have sold out of riskier assets amid broad market volatility  A rise in the U S  dollar has also helped pressure crude prices as a stronger greenback makes dollar denominated oil more expensive for buyers using other currencies  potentially putting a damper on demand 
Meanwhile  President Trump has urged Saudi Arabia and the rest of OPEC to not cut production  He has granted waivers to key buyers of Iranian oil  cushioning the effect on global supply from sanctions against the Persian Gulf producer  This comes against a backdrop of high production from the United States  Russia  and Saudi Arabia  the globe s three biggest producers 
OPEC s most recent monthly report provided more bearish news for the oil market as the cartel said increased production from the group and its ally Russia in October more than offset declines from Iran 
With the decline in oil prices Tuesday  it s perhaps not surprising that the energy sector was by far the worst performing of the S P 500 sectors  The other sectors ended with modest ups or downs 
Lower oil prices can weigh on producers because they can t get as much money for their product  But lower crude prices can be good for consumer staples stocks as drivers may end up paying less for gasoline and spend the extra money elsewhere  Manufacturers and transportation companies that use a lot of fuel can also benefit 

Figure 1  Oil Prices and Producers  This chart shows the dramatic slide in U S  oil prices  candlestick   and the pressure that seems to have placed on the energy sector  shown by a purple line representing the Energy Select Sector Index  IXE   an index made of up oil related companies in the S P 500 Data Source  Chart sources  CME Group  NASDAQ CME  and S P Dow Jones Indices  The thinkorswim  platform from TD Ameritrade  For illustrative purposes only  Past performance does not guarantee future results 
Deficit Spending  The U S  started out its fiscal year with a larger monthly budget deficit  Data from the Treasury Department yesterday showed that the nation s deficit rose slightly more than expected last month to  100 5 billion  just shy of the Briefing com consensus of  98 billion and well up from the  63 2 billion in October 2017  The increase over last year is partly due to Oct  1  2017  falling on a weekend and the government pushing payments forward  meaning they don t show up in the 2017 fiscal year  Still  the nation has been running sizable deficits  and the annual deficit is expected to hit  1 trillion  according to both White House and the Congressional Budget Office estimates  To finance the deficits  the U S  continues to rack up debt  The spend now pay later strategy can have a stimulating effect on the economy in the short term  helping to boost stocks  But that economic growth can be a double edged sword for the market  as signs of overheating could prompt the Fed to become more hawkish 
Is FAANG Losing its Bite  Arguably one of the biggest stories to emerge from the recent weeks of volatility has been what seems like a shift in investor mindset toward the FAANG stocks Facebook  NASDAQ FB   Apple  NASDAQ AAPL   Amazon  NASDAQ AMZN   Netflix  NASDAQ NFLX  and Alphabet s Google  NASDAQ GOOG  GOOGL   All of them have fallen below the levels at which they started last month  and they have tended to lead the market volatility both to the upside and the down  They re all widely held companies that can influence the broader stock market  Pulling back to look at a year to date chart through Tuesday afternoon shows a wide divergence in share performance  with FB down more than 21   GOOGL down more than 2   AAPL up more than 11   AMZN more than 37  higher  and NFLX up more than 46   With this divergence in price performance  widely differing fundamentals  and a market repricing that may not be over  it may be worth asking whether the bloc  taken as a whole  is a good representation of the so called  momentum trade  
Above the Turbulence With all the doom and gloom headlines out there it can be easy to lose sight of the bigger picture  The U S  economy is growing at a relatively robust pace for a developed nation  The Atlanta Fed s latest GDPNow model estimate  from Friday  shows a seasonally adjusted annual rate of real GDP growth in 4Q of 2 9 percent  Meanwhile  the International Monetary Fund in October said it thinks global growth will come in at 3 7  this year  That includes the impact of trade measures implemented or approved from April to the middle of last month as well as weaker outlooks for some emerging market and developing economies  So it may be worth pulling back and looking at things from a 30 000 foot view

"As the era of cloud computing heats up  many of us are still left wondering what exactly the  cloud  is  What does the cloud look like  Where is the cloud  Are we living in the cloud 
Well  we may not be technically living in the cloud  but cloud computing technology certainly surrounds the life we currently live  Interacting with the cloud is a commonplace occurrence nowadays  hailing a ride from Uber or Lyft  listening to music on Spotify or Apple s   NASDAQ AAPL   Apple Music  asking Siri or Amazon s   NASDAQ AMZN   Alexa a question about the weather 
Cloud computing  though  is made up of more than just our favorite smartphone apps and virtual assistants  It s a booming market  and companies from every facet of the industry either have a cloud computing product on the market  or are working diligently to get one there 
What  actually  is cloud computing 
Breaking it down  cloud computing simply means storing and accessing data and applications over the Internet  rather than your computer s hard drive  which is referred to as local computing  Local computing is how the industry worked for decades  Everything you need is close to you physically  making accessing your data quick and efficient for your one computer  or others on the local network 
In contrast  cloud computing requires accessing any data or applications over the Internet  and with this one stipulation  it can be done anywhere  anytime  as long as there is an online connection  You re not limited to a specific place or environment 
It s easy to think about the cloud for an individual  one who utilizes the Internet almost all day long for various things  but thinking about it on a larger scale can be hard to do  The cloud for big businesses is much different than one for everyday consumers 
For example  businesses can employ something like Software as a Service  SaaS   which allows companies to subscribe to an application over the Internet  Platform as a Service  PaaS   which lets businesses create their own applications to be used company wide  and Infrastructure as a Service  IaaS   where companies provide virtual hardware  software  servers  storage  and other components to its customers 
Consumer examples
It s easy to visualize the cloud today as similar to past flowcharts and representations that would paint the Internet s infrastructure as a white  puffy cloud  But the cloud in action looks much different 
A fairly simple example of cloud computing today is Microsoft s   NASDAQ MSFT   Office Online  which is an Internet version of the tech giant s popular Office Suite of Word  Excel  PowerPoint  and OneNote  Microsoft also offers OneDrive  which is the company s cloud storage and file syncing tool  you can download any files you create locally to OneDrive 
Alphabet Inc  s   NASDAQ GOOGL   Google division has a similar  but more popular  cloud computing offering to Microsoft s version  Google Drive gives consumers apps like Google Docs  Google Sheets  and Google Slides  with the option of accessing them on devices other than a desktop computer like a tablet or smartphone  Google s other services Gmail  Calendar  Maps  etc  can also be considered examples of cloud computing 
Not to be outdone by its main competitors  Apple also offers a comprehensive cloud computing tool  iCloud is used mainly for online backup  storage  and synchronization for mail  contacts  calendar  and much more  but the company too provides cloud based versions of its Pages  Numbers  and Keynote software  iCloud data is available on any Apple iOS  Mac OS  and Windows device 
Amazon is another big cloud computing player  Its Prime members receive a bounty of storage for any music and images that are downloaded on its Amazon Cloud Drive  you can also store any Kindle related content on this drive  Amazon Cloud Drive is basically an online storage hub for any digital products and services bought or created through Amazon 
Enterprise examples
Amazon also has its Amazon Web Services  AWS   the company s cloud services platform  It offers its customers like Netflix Inc    NASDAQ NFLX   computing power  database storage  content delivery  and other unique functions to help them grow  AWS allows Netflix to quickly deploy thousands of servers and terabytes of storage within minutes 
A force to be reckoned with in social networking  Facebook Inc    NASDAQ FB   is making headway in the cloud after the creation of the   a collection of shared computing designs that costs less to run and build than anything before it  This made the cloud affordable to Facebook  It does not yet rent out its cloud capacity  and when it does  Facebook stands to make a killing 
Other participants in the space include  Cisco Systems   NASDAQ CSCO    which provides leading networking solutions for the Internet  IBM   NYSE IBM    who offers a hybrid cloud for customized enterprise solutions  Oracle Corp    NYSE ORCL   develops cloud based software that helps companies manage and grow their businesses  and Intel Corp    NASDAQ INTC   has its Intel Cloud Technology  which is built into its latest generation of computer processors 
How to put your money in the cloud
Like its burgeoning industry cousins of  and the     cloud computing is a sector of technology that investors should consider a wise  long term investment  It s a big  booming business  having already generated  100 billion back in 2012  and is slated to reach  500 billion by 2020 
But not everyone can successfully compete in the cloud computing industry  A company needs major capital  and enough cash flow to sustain the massive amount of spending it takes to enter the market  Building those huge data centers comes at an expensive price 
It makes sense to first think of the biggest names in the industry  Apple  Microsoft  Google  and Amazon  These giants are well known and respected by both their customers and every day consumers  and their services are popular options for individual cloud computing  Their price tags  however  are not cheap  and they re not the only players in the game 
Salesforce com   NYSE CRM   has made a name for itself in the industry  and is one of the most highly valued cloud computing companies with a market cap of almost  55 billion  Unlike Microsoft and Apple  Salesforce has always focused its business around the cloud  giving them a distinct advantage in the industry 
Both Oracle and IBM have made increased efforts to highlight their respective cloud computing businesses  Each of the company s cloud segments are growing at a faster pace than their total net revenues  which is a good and brag worthy sign going forward  Oracle s cloud SaaS and PaaS revenues grew 66  in the last reported quarter  while IBM s total cloud revenues increased 30  in its most recent quarter 
Amazon s AWS  though  is a true game changer  for both the company and the industry  In 2015  revenue for Web Services grew 70  to  7 88 billion  while the business saw revenues of  2 886 billion  or a year over year increase of 58   in its most recent quarter  AWS reflects how influential cloud computing can be on a company and for its investors  and when executed correctly  it can  and will continue to be  a huge moneymaker

Bottom Line
Like many of the things about the Internet  cloud computing  in many ways  is still uncharted territory  Its central ideas have been around for a while now  but the cloud has only recently made its way to consumers  in the form of apps and devices like the smartphone  Investors should seriously consider adding one of the industry players to their portfolio  whether small or big  individual or enterprise  in order to capitalize on this surging market "
"As Chief Investment Strategist  it s my job to give you the tools you need to prosper and protect your wealth in these complicated  
And right now  range bound  sideways markets are starting to head a bit lower  so this is the perfect time to talk about a tactic we haven t covered yet 
It s an incredibly easy way to squeeze every last cent of profit out of stocks you own 
And as you ll see in a moment  using it correctly could potentially mean the difference between an easy  comfortable retirement  or years of extra toil in the office 
So let me tell you Ron C  s story  He pulled me and my team aside between presentations in Carlsbad  California  earlier this month 
As it turns out  some of his colleagues could have benefited immensely from what I m going to show you 
These Folks Delayed Their Retirement  for 17 Years  and Counting 
Ron leaned in 
 I was camping with some friends back in  99   Ron told me   They worked for Intel  and they all couldn t wait to tell me how they all planned to retire in just a couple years  since they had millions of dollars in retirement savings tied to Intel stock   clearly stock they wanted to hold   emphasis added  
Hearing they had all their eggs in one basket made him feel kind of uneasy   Guys   he said   have you thought about protecting all this  
Turns out they hadn t 
Tragically  Intel Corp   NASDAQ INTC  s stock got slammed a few months later when dot com became dot bomb  Ultimately  it would lose more than 56  of its value within just a few months  from August to December 2000 
Worse  Intel trades only  1 higher today than it did 17 years ago 
Ron never found out whether or not his camping buddies succumbed to emotion and sold Intel on the crash  But  he does know that 17 years after they d planned to retire and live like kings  they all still work at Intel 
Sigh 
Double Your Income Potential Even If Dividends Don t
Chances are you know people in a similar predicament  They re stuck working long after they could have retired simply because they didn t protect their investments when they made them  nor as they held them  Worse  they fail to take a few simple steps to maximize profits 
That s like a storekeeper not protecting his or her inventory  If it s just sitting on the shelves  it s not making money  That s great if you think somebody will come along down the line  blow off the dust  and buy what you ve got  but pretty much a waste of time in the interim 
Most investors will never think this way  which is why they ll doom themselves to mediocre returns at best and miss out on gobs of income they could have been earning all along 
Imagine you re in a situation like Ron s friends 
You pounced on Apple  NASDAQ AAPL  in November 2011 when it traded around  50 per share and picked up a cool 1 000 shares  or perhaps you worked there long enough to have accumulated 1 000 shares  Either way  your stock was worth  50 000 
Then  only 10 months later  the stock brushes past the  100 mark  meaning you ve got a 100  gain on your plate  The dividend issued in summer 2012 hasn t hurt either  which is why you re looking forward to watching your position push on even higher 
If you re really thinking ahead  you may have even decided to cash out when Apple hits a specific profit target   a move  incidentally  that puts you ahead of 99  of your investing peers 
But  what happens if Apple stumbles in the meantime 
Apple is a volatile stock  It lost more than 80  of its value in the dot com bubble  and in 2008 it also lost more than half its value from May to December  If you re not thinking about how to maximize profits when that happens  you re leaving huge amounts of money on the table that could otherwise be in your pocket 
Enter covered calls 
One Simple Strategy with Three Big Benefits
A  covered call  is an options strategy that helps you protect against meltdowns in a stock you own by selling call options 
Contrary to what many investors believe  covered calls are one of the most conservative of all options strategies  What s more  covered calls can help you beat range bound market conditions like we have right now 
In plain English  covered calls are perfect for investors who want keep the stocks they own and produce a fair amount of income  too 
Conceptually  covered calls are easy to understand and  therefore  a perfect tactic for people who want to own stocks and squeeze out every possible penny in profits 
There are three terrific benefits 
There is always less risk in buying a stock and selling covered calls against it than simply buying the same stock without selling a call 
Your cost basis is always lower when you sell a covered call than an investor who just buys the stock because the cash you receive means your breakeven is lower 
You can develop a hefty income stream above and beyond dividends because there is no limit to how many times you can sell covered calls 
To sell a covered call  you need to own the stock first  Then  you sell one call option for every 100 shares you own  Your breakeven then becomes the purchase price  less the cold hard cash you get from selling your options 
For example  right now Apple is trading at  107 59 per share  The July  110 call options are priced at  3 75 as I write this  Selling 10  because you have 1 000 shares  means you ll collect a juicy  3 750 in cold hard cash immediately  Your breakeven drops to  103 84   107 59 minus the  3 75 you receive from selling the call  
Then  one of two things is going to happen 
If Apple trades higher and is above  110 per share come July 15 when they expire  you fork over your shares  enjoy the  2 410 in profits you collect on its move and the extra  3 750 from selling your call options  Then  presumably  you do it all over again  assuming  of course  you still want to own Apple 
If Apple trades lower  you keep the cash from the call options you ve sold when they expire worthless and you keep your stock  too  Then  you rinse and repeat  selling still more options to generate more income 
Now  a quick side note 
There are legions of options traders who short circuit right about now because they believe that owning shares of a stock that s dropped below your breakeven is a bad thing  That s true if you re trading speculative junk  but remember  we re talking about stocks you want to own for the long haul here  In other words  quality stuff worthy of your investing dollars 
Obviously  I ve just scratched the surface here  Options can be as complicated as you want to make them  or as simple 
I prefer simple every time 
Covered calls can significantly boost your profits over time  and they re a great way for investors to harness profits that you d otherwise leave on the table "
"Molson Coors Brewing Company   NYSE TAP   reported a dismal second quarter 2019 results  wherein top and bottom lines missed estimates and declined year over year  This marked the company s second straight earnings miss and third consecutive negative sales surprise  The top line was impacted by soft volume that stemmed from unfavorable weather and weak industry demand across the majority of its geographies in May and June Following the soft results  shares of Molson Coors declined nearly 6 9  in the pre market trading session  Though this Zacks Rank  3  Hold  company s shares have gained 1 3  year to date  it has underperformed the  s 23 2  growth 
 
Delving DeeperMolson Coors  underlying adjusted earnings of  1 52 per share declined 19 1  year over year and missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  1 65  The decline was attributed to soft volume  cost inflation in all segments  higher marketing expenses owing to ongoing investments to support premiumization and innovation efforts  and lower G A benefits from last year  This was partly negated by positive global net pricing in all segments  gain on the sale of Montreal brewery and cost savings Molson Coors Brewing Company Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

positive global mix due to the company s focus on premiumizing its portfolio Molson Coors  worldwide brand volume declined 5 6  and financial volume fell 7  to 25 8 million hectoliters  This decline

"Software  the programs that interface between human and machine to increase the efficiency of everyday operation and communication  is taking over our lives  For one thing  children these days lead much more digitized lives than we ever did  and for another  we do a lot of things on our mobile phones than our parents ever did on their desktops  Suddenly  it s cooler to create a Facebook  NASDAQ FB  post than personally talk to people about what s going on with us 
Exponential growth in the number of machines  The really strong growth in the number of machines didn t really start until smartphones  But once it was discovered that basic communication devices can be programed to do much more  they became far more coveted  Smartphones are getting smarter by the day with companies even offering personal digital assistants  but consumers today have also incorporated other smart devices like wearables  connected home products and the Internet of Things 
So everyday things that incorporate a chip can now collect and transfer information based on programs written for them  This has led to an expansion in the definition of machines to anything that can hold a chip  and that s the scope of software for the consumer segment 
Exponential growth in data  In the past  information was shared in a format that didn t easily lend itself to management  organization and analytics  But with a large chunk of communication now happening through electronic devices  it becomes possible to collect  store and evaluate the data to generate information for businesses  healthcare providers and consumers 
IDC estimates that the world will create 180 zettabytes of this data  or 180 trillion gigabytes  in 2025  up from less than 10 zettabytes in 2015  What s more  it expects data monetization  the transformation of raw data to actionable information that is then sold for a price  to become a major revenue generator by 2017 end 
Consequently  it estimates that the market for big data and business analytics will grow at a compound annual growth rate  CAGR  of 11 7  from  130 1 billion in 2016 to more than  203 billion in 2020  Software programs work on the data at every stage and it s again software that delivers the data where required 
Cloud computing and virtualization  Both companies and individuals are getting increasingly comfortable with highly scalable shared infrastructure called the cloud  While a lot of work still remains to be done  the cloud has opened up huge possibilities for software companies  whether providing the infrastructure  IaaS   or hosting software  PaaS  or providing applications for specific functions  SaaS  
Increased virtualization of workloads and computing resources  employing both public and hybrid cloud environments indicate that the growth trend will continue  Another point to note is the relatively low penetration of the cloud in the SMB segment  which is what prompted companies like Facebook  Twitter  Google  NASDAQ GOOGL   Amazon   NASDAQ AMZN   and Microsoft   NASDAQ MSFT   to step up their game 
Security  The growing digital assets of companies mean increasing demand for security software  Although the market hasn t done exceptionally well in the last year  the secular growth prospects are obvious  Particularly considering the number of security attacks in recent times    
Digitization of entertainment  With companies like Netflix  NASDAQ NFLX   Amazon  Google s YouTube  Twitter and Facebook increasingly bringing us favorite shows  programs  movies and games on our digital devices  a growing number of people    mainly millennials and Generation Z    are moving away from TV  This is also broadening the market for software providers 
Need for automation  Another driver is increasing automation  not only of routine mental jobs like customer care that can be handled by chatbots  but also on the factory floor where robots are taking over many routine functions  These bots work on the basis of their software programming and also increasingly incorporate artificial intelligence 
As a result  a recent survey by Morgan Stanley  NYSE MS  of Chief Information Officers  people who determine and disburse IT budgets across industries  shows that the group expects external software spending to increase more than 4 2  this year beating IT budget growth rates of 3 5

"Fossil Group Inc    NASDAQ FOSL   reported narrower than expected loss in the second quarter of fiscal 2017  while sales lagged the Zacks Consensus Estimate  Shares plummeted 21 9  in after hours trading on Aug 8  as the watchmaker gave a bleaker outlook and slashed its earnings  sales and operating income guidance in response to weak results  Adding to the upheaval  the company s Chief Financial Officer Dennis Secor also announced its resignation due to personal reasons 
Adjusted loss of 23 cents per share was narrower than the Zacks Consensus Loss Estimate of 28 cents  However  it was unfavorable from the last year s earnings of 9 cents per share  largely due to decline in top line  lower gross margin and currency headwinds Fossil Group  Inc  Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise
    Quarter in Detail
This global consumer fashion accessories maker s net sales of  596 8 million in the second quarter lagged the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  619 million by 3 6   We note that the company has lagged the Zacks Consensus Estimate in nine out of the last 11 straight quarters  including the current one  Though connected watches helped in growing the company s sales  overall net sales decreased 13  from the prior year quarter  primarily due to a decline in the company s multi brand licensed watch portfolio and challenging environment for the traditional watch category  The decline in sales was wider than the 8 11 5  decline expected by the management  Declines in leather and jewelry business as well as unfavorable currency also led to the decline  Category wise  watches declined 9 3  in the quarter  while jewelry and leather business declined 22  and 25 3   respectively  Notably the sales of leathers have persistently been weak as customer response to the assortment continues to put pressure on results  On the other hand  wearables represented roughly 9  of the total sales in the second quarter  a sequential improvement from the 7  in the first quarter 
Excluding  8 3 million adverse impact from currency  sales declined 12  in the quarter  Region wise  sales declined 16  in Americas  7  in Europe  and 8  in Asia  on a constant currency basis 
Of late  Fossil has been witnessing general weakness in the watches category  The company noticed that tech enabled watches have been significantly affecting traditional watch sales  Moreover  the watch industry has become highly competitive and the company is facing competition from Apple  NASDAQ AAPL  and other technology companies  Though Fossil has been expanding into smartwatches and wearable devices  the efforts are yet to turnaround results 
Global retail comps  including e Commerce  dropped 11  year over year during the quarter with declines in all product categories and in all regions  Positive comps in Asia were more than offset by declines in Europe and the Americas 
Despite margin improvement initiatives and higher mix of international sales  gross margin declined 180 basis points  bps  to 50 5  due to lower retail margins  higher promotional activity  primarily in the outlet stores and higher mix of lower margin connected product and unfavorable currency 
In the quarter  the Richardson  Texas based company reported operating loss margin of 1 4   compared with operating margin of 2 3  in the year ago quarter  primarily due to lower sales and gross margin  currency headwinds  despite lower operating expenses 
We note that Fossil has been delivering sluggish results for a long time now  If we analyse the last six months  performance of the company  we note that Fossil s shares have declined 48 3  as compared with the   which has declined around 21 0  in the said time frame  On the other hand  the broader  sector has gained 12 5  in the last six months  Notably  the industry is part of the bottom 37  of the Zacks Classified industries  166 out of the 265  

Other Financial Update
At the end of the second quarter  the company had cash and cash equivalents of  319 8 million and long term debt of  613 6 million and shareholders  equity of  654 8 million 
Outlook
For 2017  Fossil expects net sales to decline in the range of 4 5 8 5   more than the previous range of down 1 5 6 0   The company also expects adjusted operating margin in the range of 2 0 3 5   unfavorable than the previously anticipated adjusted operating margin range of 3 0 4 5   Further  it projects 2017 adjusted earnings in the range of 35 cents to  1 15 per share  as compared with previously expected band of 80 cents  1 50  In fact  the company posted adjusted earnings of  1 80 in fiscal 2016  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for fiscal 2017 is currently pegged at 93 cents per share that is within the company s guided range 
For the third quarter of fiscal 2017  Fossil expects loss of 26 cents to earnings of 7 cents per share and adjusted operating margin in a range of 1 2 2 0   The company expects net sales to decline in the range of 8 0 14 0  
Fossil continues to expect a challenging retail environment and pressure on the traditional watch category to persist  Currency will also continue to remain a headwind in 2017  Nevertheless  as demand for technology in wrist wear is increasingly rising among consumers  this Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  company expects to capitalize the demand for wearables through a significant number of new products expected to launch in September and continue through the holiday season  The company has also connected celebrities with the wearable brands to reintroduce customers to the Fossil brand  The company expects to increase its marketing spending by over 40  in fiscal 2017 on wearables in order to build awareness for the new functionality available in these fashion first technology accessories  Furthermore  it is on track to double the SKU count to nearly 300 this year and will add five more brands including DKNY  Marc Jacobs  MICHELE  Relic and Tory Burch  joining the already nine brands in its wearables platform  In fact  the company remains confident that wearables have the ability to help mitigate the ongoing softness in the traditional watch category 
Moving ahead  Fossil continues to focus on the New World Fossil restructuring program along with growth in the company s core watch business and product expansion  This restructuring initiative is likely to create a better operating platform that will cater to its customers efficiently in a tough retail landscape  Owing to the efforts  the company expects to deliver roughly 40  of the program s overall  200 million profit improvement in 2017 results 
The company is also making efforts to relocate its resources to drive growth  As a result  the company is looking for store closures to drive savings this year and will remain focused to exit underperforming locations  primarily through natural lease expirations  For fiscal 2017  the company expects to close nearly 50 stores in addition to the 50 stores closed last year

T2108 Status  21 0   intraday low of 19 9    essentially oversold VIX Status  20 5  retested level that launched summer swoon in 2011 General  Short term  Trading Call  Scale into longs for short term bounce from oversold conditionsActive T2108 periods  Day  1 under 30   underperiod   Day  2 under 40   Day  20 under 70   underperiod Commentary If I had a bearish bias coming into today  I would have collected a large payday on ProShares Ultra S P 500  SSO  puts  Even sticking with the older plan of playing a breakdown from the wedge would have yielded great results today as the S P 500  SPY  gapped down exactly under the bear bull dividing line and sold off in a near straight line from there  However  just as I did not play the breakout  thank goodness for wariness ahead of the Fed meeting    I did not play the bearish angle of today s breakdown as I was on watch for oversold conditions Today s 2 5  loss on the S P 500  SPY  was the index s largest loss since a 3 7  plunge November 9  2011  T2108 plunged in response with a gut wrenching 39 6  loss down to 21   This was T2108 s largest one day loss since a 49 1  plunge on May 21  2010 where T2108 hit an amazingly low 9 7   The 52 0  2 day plunge was T2108 s largest since a 56 1  2 day loss on August 8  2011 when T2108 closed at 11 5   Since 1990  there have only been 18 occurrences of T2108 dropping at least as much as it has done in the past two days  Like today  all of these plunges happened below both the 20 and 50DMAs  At its low for the day  T2108 hit 19 8   oversold conditions  the picture perfect and sharp bounce from oversold levels tells me I am not the only one watching these levels closely    Put this all together and not only is T2108 quasi oversold  but it is also essentially  classically  oversold The sheer scale of what happened today took me off guard  I did not think the market would hit oversold conditions until next week and certainly not drop with such ferocity As on previous occasions with the potential for  quasi  oversold conditions  I ran the T2108 Trading Model  TTM  to look for an early start on trading  As I noted in an earlier post  I learned that sensitivity analysis is important in interpreting the results  I have not yet adjusted the code to accommodate multiple scenarios  but I did run the model several times throughout the day  The results were VERY instructive  I tweeted some of these  in chronological order  If  SPY closed here   T2108 model projecting 72  odds of up day tomorrow  Model surprisingly only depends on  T2108 close  Will monitor Technicals worse   T2108 model still has 72  odds of  SPY up Fri  Model now only depends on  VIX   chng  Will continue sensitivity analysis Odds shot up to 82   Model looking sufficiently robust  Depends on  VIX and  T2108 close  Scaling into  SSO calls   120trade T2108 model dropped odds of up day tomorrow to 64   not so good   So I am thinking I get another opp to add to  SSO calls at lower prices  T2108 model final odds for up day tomorrow   68   Borderline  Decision tree reduced to 1 node  Conditions ripe for  SPY gap down buying oppNot only did I check the projections  I checked the best model for the classification algorithm  Each one had a different feature  single node  or dependent on just a close above a threshold on the VIX change and or a threshold for the T2108 close  No threshold was ever even close to levels current at the time  The preponderance of predictions for an up day gave me the confidence to start scaling into SSO calls even ahead of official oversold conditions  think of this as a play on quasi oversold   I started small  using July calls  My intention with these plays is always boom or bust  so I like buying some time premium in case a scenario unfolds that just requires more time  I set the capital at risk like a stop loss  The day ended with a projection of a 72 2  chance of an up day tomorrow  June 21st   The model is a single node because the entire  problem space  only contains 18 cases  And these 18 cases are remarkably similar to the current one  Of these 18 cases  the S P 500 closed down only 5 times the following day  The range of returns has been extremely wide  as low as  6 6  on August 8  2011 to  6 3  on November 21  2008  Thirteen  13  of the eighteen  18  cases have occurred since 2007  one in 2011  and none in 2012    and boy do we have it  With the S P 500 trading well below its lower Bollinger Band  a PERFECT scenario tomorrow will be another gap down that really over stretches the selling  I will be loading up on SSO calls at the point with T2108 most likely in a deep oversold position  and the index stretched well beyond the typical band of recent volatility  Of course  I will not complain if the index instead gaps up tomorrow  but I think there is a lot more money to be made playing deep oversold levels  Even though I remain bullish  I have heaps more caution to throw on the table for good measure  The S P 500 has technically broken down  I can play oversold bounces for one  maybe two days   however long it takes to rally back into overhead resistance  The bulls now have a LOT to prove and will have a major hurdle ahead of them trying to climb above what should be stiff resistance at the 50DMA  As always  I take this one step at a time  so I cannot confirm that I will quickly switch to bearish upon a retest  although that IS the technically correct bias to have    Most importantly  the VIX remains resilient  I have been pointing out how the VIX has not shown such an ability to stay aloft above the key 15 2 pivot  Today was the resounding confirmation of the warning the VIX has been delivering  The VIX ended its travels at a level that should send chills in anyone with a memory  The VIX traded above  and then pulled back just under  the same level that served as a breakdown point for the 2011 summer swoon  I conclude with a chart of Apple  AAPL   In a rare display of relative strength  AAPL actually rallied quickly from its lows before fading to rejoin the selling in the market  Earlier in the week  I tweeted that the declining 20DMA put the May low into play  Today  AAPL tested that low  bounced back sharply  but still ended up below the lower BB  This move completes a breakdown from 50DMA support and the old pivot around  532  While I still think  will hold  it seems a gut wrenching retest of those lows is in the cards perhaps even BEFORE July earnings Note again that the  Apple Trading Model   aka ATM  is working well in this case with AAPL getting progressively weaker going into the end of the week  After selling out of my puts  I dipped early into an AAPL call expiring NEXT Friday Black line  T2108  measured on the right   Green line  S P 500  for comparative purposes Red line  T2108 Overbought  70    Blue line  T2108 Oversold  20  Be careful out there Full disclosure  long SSO calls  long AAPL shares and calls
"By Stella Qiu  Yawen Chen and Philip Wen ZHENGZHOU  China  Reuters    Dressed in a smart black pantsuit behind the wheel of her pearl white Audi  Zhao Na has come a long way from her roots in rural Henan province  in central China  The 29 year old real estate agent cheerfully admits to having shopaholic ways and a love of Louis Vuitton and Prada handbags  typifying a wave of free spending consumers who have had the world s top brands scrambling for a piece of China s  5 trillion plus retail market   When I am flush  I am happy to part with money   said Zhao  who once splurged around 60 000 yuan   9 000  on a clutch of handbags during a trip to Paris in 2017   Spending makes me happy   But with China s economy slowing  Zhao s business has hit a wall and her income has plummeted  forcing her to shelve that source of happiness  She has scrapped the European shopping trips and weaned herself off buying binges at her favorite mall  David Plaza  where giant digital screens flash advertisements for brands like Gucci  Lancome and Ermenegildo Zegna in the center of Zhengzhou  Henan s capital   Not being able to spend money as I like makes me feel lousy  but I cannot do much about it   Zhao said  REALITY CHECK An economic slowdown in China  after three decades of unbridled growth  is being felt especially keenly by consumers like Zhao in Henan  The province  with its 100 million people  is a key pillar of China s aspirations to transform its economy by boosting domestic spending and raising living standards in the country s interior  But according to dozens of interviews with consumers and merchants across Henan  as well as trade group data  people in the province are spending less on everything from cars and household appliances to clothing and cosmetics   Map of Henan province    Scaled back consumption by inland urbanites like Zhao could have serious repercussions for China s economic growth  already imperiled by an escalating trade war with the United States  It could also be a reality check for global retailers  The Italian suit maker Ermenegildo Zegna  the American luxury jeweler Tiffany  and Apple  NASDAQ AAPL  have all warned that consumers across China are paring back spending   On Wednesday  China reported weak growth in retail sales  and a drop in spending on clothing for the first time in a decade   Slowing spending in inland cities such as Zhengzhou could dent the ambitions of global retailers that have pinned their hopes on future growth in regions like Henan  the largest provincial economy beyond China s prosperous coastal regions  A PROVINCE TRANSFORMED  Long a dusty provincial capital  Zhengzhou s transformation in recent years into a metropolis with a glittering skyline and fashionable malls has been staggering   The city of 10 million is a key transportation hub on China s Belt and Road network  linked by rail to Central Asia and Europe beyond  with high speed connections to Beijing and Shanghai  The Taiwan contract manufacturer Foxconn has built an enormous iPhone factory in the city that employs 230 000 people  Ambitious young people once typically fled Henan to seek better lives elsewhere  But Zhengzhou now gives them a place to pursue their middle class dreams  earning more and being able to afford their own modern homes and an array of consumer goods  For Zhao  the city was a beacon of hope  Born into a family of farmers in rural Henan  the youngest of three children  Zhao dreamed from an early age of escaping her impoverished village  She did well in school  which allowed her to attend university in Zhengzhou  where she discovered a talent for sales  She joined a property developer  working for rich clients sporting designer clothes and fancy handbags  Soon  she was able to taste that lifestyle herself as she began racking up lucrative commissions on sales of top end apartments in Zhengdong New Area  a commercial district where luxury hotels and office towers have sprouted from farmland  She became a regular at the high end shops of David Plaza and bought a car and two homes  letting one of them out on Airbnb   Supplementing the commissions  Zhao also piled up debt on her half dozen credit cards  She says she owes about 200 000 yuan in credit card debt  on top of monthly mortgage and car payments totaling 15 000 yuan   But as Zhengzhou s frenzied property market cooled last year  sales plummeted  along with her commissions  And that put an end to her shopping trips to David Plaza  Zhao is not alone in cutting back  Consumer confidence in provincial cities such as Zhengzhou fell slightly last year after hitting its highest level in at least nine years in 2017  according to Nielsen  a research firm  Retail sales growth in Zhengzhou fell to single digits last year for the first time in nearly two decades  At two malls in Zhengzhou s downtown shopping district  retailers selling cosmetic brands like Kiehl s and Clinique said customers were becoming more careful    They used to buy a lot and spend their money rather carelessly   said Li Mengru  the cosmetic sales manager at the Dennis Department Store who oversees brands including Chanel  Dior and  Estee Lauder   NYSE EL    Now they are becoming choosier as they turn cautious about spending   EASY MONEY A key driver of consumption in China in recent years has been the explosion of new finance options  including peer to peer loans and endless opportunities for acquiring credit cards  That put a wealth of consumer goods in reach for people previously unable to afford them  Chai Maofeng  a 28 year old beef distributor in Xuchang  a Henan city of about 4 million people  opened ten credit card accounts in 2016 to furnish his apartment with a sofa set  refrigerator  air conditioners and televisions   all brand new   Opening a credit card account was easy   banks were happy to lend to you  and all you needed was a landline number that suggested you worked in an office   said Chai  But Chai said he had to put his freespending ways on hold after the economic slowdown started hurting his business  which had also been hit by a sweeping crackdown on polluting industries that pushed up beef prices  Chai said he had put off plans to buy a second property and a new car   This one from the company is actually fine   he said  referring to the white van his company lets him use  WORSE TO COME   China s economy showed signs of recovery in the first quarter  with gross domestic product growing more than expected by analysts  But an intensifying trade war with the United States  sluggish factory activity and slowing global demand for Chinese products suggest the slowdown will continue through 2019  most economists say  Efforts by Beijing to rein in credit and risky debt over the past few years to contain speculative bubbles has also reduced the amount of easy money available for many consumers  Those factors are likely to keep weighing on consumer spending  analysts say  Beijing has taken steps to prop up spending  announcing plans in January for subsidies to boost purchases of cars  an industry that saw sales decline last year for the first time in two decades  The government has also sought to increase take home pay by reducing the income tax burden for many individuals   Graphic  Henan s skidding auto sales     But government help is unlikely to offset a decline in confidence stemming from slowing income growth and rising household debt  analysts say  For all that  consumers have not stopped spending altogether  On a recent afternoon in downtown Zhengzhou  David Plaza was bustling  with shoppers checking out the latest lipsticks and sipping lattes in coffee shops  But Zhao was not among them  Staring at almost 30 years of mortgage payments ahead of her  and the car loans she still needs to repay  she said it might be a while before she shops at the mall again  
 With income falling  I have to make every penny count   Zhao said   Unnecessary luxury spending has to go for now  "
For Immediate ReleaseChicago  IL   June 6  2019   Zacks com announces the list of stocks featured in the Analyst Blog  Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets  Stocks recently featured in the blog include  Apple   NASDAQ AAPL    Facebook   NASDAQ FB    Amazon   NASDAQ AMZN    Google   NASDAQ GOOGL   and Microsoft   NASDAQ MSFT   Here are highlights from Wednesday s Analyst Blog  Buy Apple  AAPL  Despite Worries on WWDC  Services  PrivacyApple shares popped Wednesday morning during what has been a hectic time  from antitrust lawsuits to U S  China trade war worries  More troublesome  the iPhone giant is coming off a back to back dip in quarterly profit and sales  But the firm is determined to push forward with a more diverse future that it showed off at its Apple Worldwide Developers Conference Trade War   Antitrust Worries Apple at the moment is safe from President Trump s decision to increase tariffs on  200 billion worth of Chinese products to 25   However  Trump has threated to impose a 25  tariff on an additional  325 billion worth of Chinese exports to the U S  The Chinese government has countered the Trump administration with its own tariffs Yet  Apple might be more concerned about the possibility that the Chinese government calls for boycotts on U S  companies  This is not hard to imagine if the trade war escalates further  especially since the Chinese market is full of less expensive  Chinese made smartphone options from the likes of Xiaomi and Huawei Meanwhile  on Tuesday one of the first developer lawsuits against Apple was filed in California  The suit claims that the developers are forced to sell their iOS apps through the App Store because of Apple s monopoly over app distribution  This comes after the U S  Supreme Court in May allowed antitrust lawsuits against Apple regarding its app store business model to proceed  Apple requires all apps to be sold exclusively through its own app store  where it typically takes a 30  cut On top of all of this  new reports say that the U S  Justice Department and the Federal Trade Commission are possibly preparing to investigate some of the biggest names in tech  including Apple  for possible antitrust violations  according to the Wall Street Journal  This list also includes Facebook  Amazon and Google  also read  Buy Netflix  NASDAQ NFLX  Stock as FTC  DOJ Set Antitrust Sights on Tech Giants  Privacy  WWDC   Services Apple over the last year has spent heavily on advertising that touts its commitments to privacy in order to get out ahead of what CEO Tim Cook and others see as possible threats  Facebook helped kick off this wave of privacy worries that have morphed into more full throated attacks from government officials in the U S  and Europe regarding Facebook  Google  and others like Apple and their access to user data and control over the spread of information  Fittingly  Apple dove into many of its new privacy features during the first day of its developers conference Apple said that its next generation operating system  iOS 13  which is due out this fall  is set to offer sign in capabilities that offer users the chance to log into apps without providing any personal information  Apple executives said that it would instead auto generate random email addresses provided by the iPhone maker  The company also talked about some other new privacy features  Clearly  developers  who need or want at least some user data  won t love this and could help further their antitrust claims With that said  Apple does make money from devices  while its tech titan peers Google and Facebook mostly profit from ads and the collection of user data  To that end  Apple showed off its brand new  iPad specific operating system  iPadOS  aimed to help it function more like a traditional computer  Meanwhile  the Apple Watch will have its own app store in a move to try to untether the smartwatch from the iPhone Furthermore  Apple showed the first trailer from one of its new TV shows called For All Mankind  This is part of the company s streaming TV service that is projected to launch in the fall and hopes to compete against Netflix and Disney  Apple TV  is part of its larger Services push that includes the company s Spotify  NYSE SPOT  competitor Apple Music  its new  9 99 per month magazine heavy news service  and more   Outlook Apple s Q2 2019 revenue fell 5 1   which marked a larger decline than Q1 s 4 5  decline  More specifically  second quarter revenue in Greater China tumbled 21 5  from the year ago quarter to  10 22 billion  Overall  Greater China accounted for roughly 18  of Apple s total quarterly revenue  Plus  Q2 iPhone sales tumbled over 17  and made up over 53  of sales Investors should note that Apple s Services sales climbed 16  in Q2 to reach  11 45 billion and account for nearly 20  of total quarterly revenue  This  however  came in below Q1 s 19  expansion and marked a slowdown from other recent periods Our current Zacks Consensus Estimates call for the firm s adjusted full year earnings to slip 3 6  on the back of a 3 3  revenue decline  Looking further down the road  the company s fiscal 2020 earnings are projected to jump nearly 11  above our current year estimate on roughly 4  higher revenues which are expected to come in above

  Brian and Jeremy Agree to Disagree on whether it s time to buy FANG stocks again
	  Kevin answers your questions in Zacks Mailbag
	  Sheraz and Brian choose one portfolio to give feedback for improvement
	  And much more

So be sure to mark your calendar then log on to Zacks com and bookmark this page  We had another volatile session on Monday  but at least the swing into the close was to the positive side this time 
	Stocks started the session solidly in the red after news broke that the Brexit vote in the UK would be delayed  The Dow slumped by more than 500 points at its worst  while the S P dipped under its October low 
	Mercifully  the market finally calmed down and started its long recovery due  in part  to good old technology  The NASDAQ was the first major index to cross back over to the positive side and ended with the biggest gain  It was up 0 74  to 7020 52 
	The FAANGs were all higher  especially Facebook  NASDAQ FB    3 22    Perhaps most importantly  Apple  NASDAQ AAPL  advanced 0 66   which is pretty impressive when you consider it had been down by more than 2  in the session 
	The S P slipped below 2600 momentarily  but then the bulls started charging  The index ended with an improvement of 0 18  to 2637 72   Counterstrike editor Jeremy Mullin has more on this in the highlights section below   The Dow recovered from the 500 point deficit to gain 0 14   or about 34 points  to 24 423 26  The day ended up being a lot better than I thought it would after this morning  I was searching for support levels and finally the market broke higher  It would be great to see the market shaking off some of the bearishness it saw last week  As long as the trade war rhetoric dies down I should get my wish   said Dave Bartosiak  editor of Surprise Trader  Momentum Trader and Blockchain Innovators 
	That recovery sure felt great after last week s more than 4  losses across the board  However  the crazy volatility shows that this market is still in a nervous state and susceptible to the headlines  We could use some actual good news right now 
	The Fed meets on December 18  19 and is still expected to hike rates for the fourth time this year  More importantly  what will Fed Chair Jerome Powell have to say about future hikes  He helped maintain a market rally late last month with a dovish speech  and since then the odds for increases in 2019 have moved lower  Another light touch on his part could be enough to cue Santa 
	But that s next week  We ve just begun this week  If there s any real progress on the trade front  the next few days would be a great time to announce it  But that s a big  if    Today s Portfolio Highlights 
	ETF Investor  The market is dealing with fears of a slowing economy  which actually has the Fed considering fewer rate hikes in 2019  Just a few months ago  we were expecting 3 increases next year  but that is down to only one increase since Fed Chair Powell s dovish speech two weeks ago  This new environment is bad news for banks  but good news for REITs 
	Therefore  Neena made a couple of changes on Monday  The editor sold SPDR S P Regional Banking ETF  NYSE KRE  and replaced it with the addition of Vanguard REIT ETF  VNQ   The new fund is the most popular ETF for REITs since its cheap and has  32 billion in AUM  VNQ also has a dividend yield of 4 7   Read Neena s full write up for more on today s changes TAZR Trader  The portfolio has been so cautious during this market volatility that Kevin has a cash position of 90   But after another sharp plunge this morning  the editor now is using fundamental technical behavioral  FTB  analysis to capitalize on those  buy buckets  filled by panicked investors  He bought the following four names today 
	  Square  NYSE SQ    7  allocation
	  Apple  AAPL    7  allocation
	  Finance 3X Bull  FAS    10  allocation
	  3X Small Cap ETF  TNA    10  allocation
	Kevin always planned to buy SQ below  60 and now it s close enough  while consensus estimates for AAPL have barely moved during all the downgrades and selloffs  FAS and TNA are both the editor s bets that plenty of worry is priced in and we are headed into a relief rally before or after the Fed meeting  Read the complete commentary for specifics on all of today s moves  Black Box Trader  This week s adjustment included three swaps  The stocks sold today included 
	  Booz Allen Hamilton  BAH 
	  MetLife  NYSE MET 
	  Hertz Global Holdings  HTZ 
	The new buys that replaced these names are 
	  Abercrombie   Fitch  ANF 
	  RH  RH 
	  Exelon Corp   NYSE EXC 
	Read the Black Box Trader s Guide to learn more about this computer driven service designed to take the emotion out of investing Zacks Confidential  Even in this frustrating correction  there are plenty of standout stocks  But you need to stay calm and know where to look  Brian Bolan knows where you should focus in 2019  which is why Kevin put him at the helm for this week s Zacks Confidential  Learn about the obstacles investors will have to overcome and the ingredients for finding the best stocks by clicking  Three Growth Stocks for 2019 Counterstrike   Huge day for the nervous bulls as they defended the 2600 level and trapped some short sellers in the process  Early selling looked bad and the break under 2600 likely cause some weak hands to get stopped out  However  after Europe closed the bulls were able to push price higher for a big bull win 
	 If the market wants some legs  it needs to continue higher tomorrow  We don t have to go straight up  but we need to rebuild our way back to 2700  Going forward that can be your line in the sand  Over 2700 you can start getting bullish  Under 2700 we will remain cautious 
	 The bulls won the battle today  but this week has four more days left and a lot of headlines are sure to come  There has been a lot of damage done over the last two months and if Santa Claus is going to show up this year  we need a positive week      Jeremy Mullin
	Have a Good Evening

"As the trading year comes to an end  now is a good time to reflect on what you did right in the market  what you did wrong  and what you d like to do better in the new year 
This includes patting yourself on the back for your successes 
Being honest with yourself for your failures 
And setting big goals for what you d like to accomplish 
Like doubling your investment returns   That s right  double  
Think Big
It takes no more mental energy to work on a big goal than it does to work on a small one 
But the end results can be enormous 
Most people set their sights on small ideas because they don t yet know how they ll achieve them 
But in today s day and age  somebody has likely accomplished the very thing you ve set out to do    and left a roadmap on how to do it 
And for those who may think the market has already made its move and it s too late  think again 
Continued      
                                                                                                      

Did you miss Apple  NASDAQ AAPL  s 9X stock price explosion after they launched their iPhone in 2007  Ten years later  3 tech trends are taking shape that could dwarf the iPhone powered move 
Today you are invited to download 3 Zacks  Bonus Reports on Internet of Things  Artificial Intelligence  Driverless Cars   trends predicted to create markets worth more than  1 7 trillion  Best of all  each free report names a handful of stocks to buy now just as the technology is starting to catch fire  Important  Opportunity expires midnight Sunday  December 10 

                                                                                                      
The market has been trading within a perfectly defined uptrend since Q1 of 2009  and shows no sign of slowing  In fact  it actually looks like it s speeding up and getting stronger 
This year  with only another few weeks to go  the market is on pace for a  20  gain  And with GDP doubling  corporate profits surging  and consumer confidence at a 17 year high  the stage is set for another banner year in 2018 
And with the bullish backdrop in place  that means significantly larger upside potential in individual stocks where you could see gains of 25   50   even 100  or more  if you know where to look 
Do What Works
So which stocks should move the most  Stick with tried and true methods that work to find the best ones 
This is part of the roadmap to success 
For example  did you know that stocks with a Zacks Rank  1 Strong Buy have beaten the market in 24 of the last 29 years with an average annual return of 25   That s more than two times the S P  But when doing this year after year  that can add up to a lot more than just two times the returns 
And did you also know that stocks in the top 50  of Zacks Ranked Industries outperforms those in the bottom 50  by a factor of 2 to 1  There s a reason why they say that half of a stock s price movement can be attributed to the group that it s in  Because it s true 
Those two things will give any investor a huge probability of success and put you well on your way to achieving your goals 
But you re not there yet  as those two items alone will only narrow down a field of 10 000 stocks to the top 100 or so  Way too many to trade at once 
So the next step is to get that list down to the best 5 10 stocks that you can buy 
Proven Profitable Strategies
Picking the best stocks is a lot easier when there s a proven  profitable method to do it 
And by concentrating on what has proven to work in the past  you ll have a better idea as to what your probability of success will be now and in the future 
For example  if your strategy did nothing but lose money year after year  trade after trade  over and over again  there s no way you d want to use that strategy to pick stocks with  Why  Because it s proven to pick bad stocks 
On the other hand  if your strategy did great year after year  trade after trade  over and over again  you d of course want to use that strategy to pick stocks with  Why  Because it s proven to pick winning stocks 
Of course  this won t preclude you from ever having another losing trade  But if your stock picking strategy picks winners more often than losers  you can feel confident that your next trade will have a high probability of success 
Stock Picking Secrets of the Pros
Once of the best ways to begin doubling your returns is to see what the pros are doing 
There s no one perfect way to beat the market  Some traders prefer high flying growth stocks  while others prefer deeply discounted value stocks  Some may prefer fast paced momentum stocks  whereas others are more comfortable with mature  dividend producing income stocks 
Yet others may want to focus on more specialized strategies like insider trading  the legal kind   institutional buying and selling  large caps  small caps  stocks about to surprise  or cheap stocks under  10 
Still others may want to turn their attention to specific sectors or industries like healthcare innovators  biotech stocks  or high tech companies 
Or even incorporate options into their portfolio 
Regardless of which one fits your personal style of trade  just be sure you re getting the best advice from experts who have demonstrated their ability to beat the market 
I m happy to say  our team of experts has performed spectacularly this year  with 9 of our most popular portfolio services beating the market  including my very own Options Trader service  which was up 43 7  as of 11 30 17 
The best part about these strategies  aside from the returns  is that all of the hard work is done for you  There s no guesswork involved  Just follow the experts and start trading like a pro 
Roadmap to Success
As you can see  there s a clear roadmap to success to help you achieve your goal of doubling your stock returns in 2018 
No need to reinvent the wheel  The path has already been created  Now it s just about doing it  And once you decide to do something  it s amazing how often those decisions come true 
And just like anything  it only requires a few simple steps to get the ball rolling

"The market s favorable momentum in recent days is likely not a reflection of its happiness with corporate earnings reports  but rather a result of optimism about some of the macro worries that weighed on sentiment in the last quarter of 2018 
This doesn t mean that Q4 earnings results are bad  they are not  But rather that they aren t so good that the market would be cheering them 
We probably shouldn t get too definitive in our conclusions about the Q4 earnings season at this stage  After all  we have seen results from only 11  of S P 500 members and the sample of results at this stage is weighted towards the Finance sector  The Q4 reporting cycle ramps up materially this week  with another 56 S P 500 members representing all the major sectors coming out with quarterly results 
Here are the key takeaways from the Q4 earnings season after seeing results from 55 S P 500 members through Friday  January 18th 
First  growth is decelerating  This isn t a surprise  as we knew already that Q4 growth would be materially below the pace set in the first three quarters of the year 
Total earnings for the 55 index members that have reported are up  16 9  from the same period last year on  9  higher revenues  Earnings and revenue growth for the same cohort of companies had been  22  and  9 7  in the preceding earnings season  The comparison chart below puts this growth deceleration in a historical context for these 55 index members 
The growth pace is on track to decelerate even further in the current and coming quarters  as we will show a little later 
Second  positive surprises are hard to come by  particularly on the revenues side 
For the 55 index members that have reported results already  70 9  are beating EPS estimates and only 56 4  are beating revenue estimates  For the same cohort of companies  the proportion of positive EPS and revenue surprises was 83 6  and 60  in the Q3 earnings season  The comparison charts below put the Q4 beats percentages in a historical context for these 55 companies
Positive revenue beats have not been this hard to come by in a while  In fact  the proportion of positive Q4 revenue surprises is the weakest in the last three years  as the chart below shows 
With Q4 positive surprises this hard to come by  one would reasonably assume that perhaps estimates had been too high  We know that wasn t the case as estimates for the quarter had fallen the most of any other recent periods 
Third  estimates for 2019 Q1 and full year 2019 are coming down in a major way  with the Q1 growth rate at risk of falling into negative territory 
The chart below shows how estimates for 2011 Q1 have evolved since late November 2018 
The negative revisions to 2019 Q1 estimates are along the same lines that we saw ahead of the start of the Q4 earnings season as well  Estimates for full year 2019 have been coming down as well  as the chart below shows 
This chart is tracking consensus earnings growth expectations since the second half of 2018 got underway  As you can see  estimates were effectively unchanged during the September quarter  but they have been on a consistent downtrend since early October  Many in the market suspect that estimates have further to drop before stabilizing 
Key Earnings Reports This Week
Monday  January 21st  No releases because of the MLK holiday
Tuesday  January 22nd  We have 11 index members reporting results on Tuesday  with Johnson   Johnson  NYSE JNJ   JNJ  and Comcast  CMCSA  as the major releases in the morning and IBM  IBM  after the market s close 
Wednesday  January 23rd  We have 20 S P 500 members reporting results that day  with Proctor   Gamble  PG  in the morning and Ford  F  in the evening as the major ones 
Thursday  January 24th  We have another 20 index members on deck to reports results on Thursday  with Intel  INTC  and Starbucks  SBUX  as big reporters  both after the market s close 
Friday  January 25th  Another 6 index members report results on Friday  all in the morning 
Q4 Earnings Season Scorecard  as of Jan  18th  2019 
We now have Q4 results from 55 S P 500 members that combined account for 15 1  of the index s total market capitalization  Total earnings for these 55 index members are up  16 9  from the same period last year on  9  higher revenues  with 70 9  beating EPS estimates and 56 4  beating revenue estimates 
For the Finance sector  we now have Q4 results from 45 8  of the sector s total market cap in the S P 500 index  Total earnings for these Finance companies are up  15 8  from the same period last year on  3 9  higher revenues  with 72 7  beating EPS estimates and 45 5  beating revenue estimates 
The comparison charts below put the Finance sector s Q4 results in a historical context 
 
For Q4 as a whole  total earnings for the S P 500 index are expected to be up  10 7  from the same period last year on  5 3  higher revenues  which would follow the  25 7  earnings growth on  8 4  higher revenues in 2018 Q3 
Earnings growth is expected to be in double digits for 8 of the 16 Zacks sectors  with Energy   60 5  growth   Finance   20 3    Construction   24 5   and Transportation   25 5   as the strongest growth  Tech sector earnings are expected to decelerate meaningfully in Q4  up  3 8   after back to back quarters of very strong growth  The Tech sector s growth pace has come down the most in recent days as analysts adjusted their estimates lower following the Apple  NASDAQ AAPL  pre announcement 
Three sectors are expected to have lower earnings in Q4 relative to the year earlier period  namely Conglomerates   13 1  decline   Autos   15 4   and Utilities   7 3   
The table below shows the summary picture for Q4  contrasted with what was actually achieved in the preceding earnings season 
The chart below shows Q4 earnings and revenue growth expectations contrasted with what is expected in the following three quarters and actual results in the preceding 4 quarters  As you can see in the chart below  the growth pace is expected to decelerate materially from what we saw in the first three quarters of the year 
The chart below shows the same data on a rolling 4 quarter basis 
Whether we look at the growth picture on a quarterly basis or on a rolling quarter basis  there is no doubt that growth peak is now behind us  The question now is how much estimates for the coming quarters have still to come down  And the answer to that question will depend on the evolving economic backdrop that we discussed at the start

"Current Position of the Market
S P 500  Long term trend   The bull market is continuing with a top expected in the low 3000s 
 Intermediate trend  A new surge of buyinghas moved ahead the forecast for anintermediate term top 
Analysis of the short term trend is done on a daily basis with the help of hourly charts  It is an important adjunct to the analysis of daily and weekly charts which discusses the course of longer market trends  
Market Overview
I have seriously underestimated the extent of the uptrend which started with the low of the 7 year cycle at 1810  I was looking for a phase count to take us to a 2660 top  but that turned out to be a short term stop with S P 500 only pausing briefly at the end of 2017 and  re invigorated by the tax bill  it shot up another 200 points in less than a month  An eventual move to the low 3000s had beenanticipated and posted under  Long term trend    above   but I did not expect it to be approximated this quickly  In spite of its near exponential trajectory  S P 500 appears to be building the normal staircase pattern to its next significant projection target  This means that driven by minor cycles  the index formsa re accumulation pattern whichgives usa good idea of what level will be reached at the next minorcycle high  and this process is repeated until it nears the next important price projection  begins to break uptrend lines and eventually reverses its trend 
Currently  we are coming to the end of such a process  Last Wednesday  S P 500 started to build a new base after the minor cycle made its low  and it rapidly formed an impressive re accumulation pattern which ended late Thursday with the start of a new short term uptrend thathas quickly reached the vicinity of the new price target  given in Thursday s Market Summary   Friday s close fell a little shy of the stated projection but it is expected to be filled on Monday Morning  A minor reversal should then take us tothe next cycle low ideally due on Tuesday  This is expected to be a very short correction following the partial completion of the total base count  The next upside target will be included in Monday morning s update 
Chart Analysis These charts and subsequent ones courtesy of QCharts 
S P 500 daily chart
About two months ago  expecting S P 500 to top at about 2700  I mentioned that we would have a confirmed reversal when trend line  1 was broken  At the end of December  the trend line was tested  held  and instead of giving a sell signal  the index started an accelerated rally away from the trend line  This has brought the price above several top channel lines which should have contained prices   and there are higher projections directly ahead  It s clear that S P 500 has a definite objective in mind for this intermediate top   After doing a thorough review of the 1810 base on the long term P F chart  I have a better idea of what it should be  Only minor cycles lie ahead for the immediate future  and S P 500 is taking advantage of this favorable cyclic condition to reach its objective before a more important cycle threatens to reverse it course 
If you look at the chart below  you will see that a new trend line has formed which is much steeper than trend line  1  This is obviously the one on which we must focus for an indication that we are near the top  But a break of this trend linewillprobably not yet signal the beginning of the expected intermediate correction  After it is broken  another will form at a less steep angle  and this process may have to be repeatedonce or twice more before we are in a position to break trend line  1 and to   finally  start an intermediate downtrend 
One thing that I have found misleading has been the behavior of the breadth index  I have never seen it show such a lack of support for prices for this length of time  If you look at the lowest oscillator  you will understand why I say this  It has been showing relative weakness to the price chart for a long period of time  once again proving the old adage that  Price is King  

S P 500 hourly chart 
I have often mentioned some of the advantages of the P F charts over bar charts  Here we have a good example of this  I have highlighted in green two consolidation patterns  The one on the left took two weeks to form  The one on the right  a day and a half  And yet  when converted into P F charts  they are almost equal in length  which means that they have nearly the same projection count  One could not realize this simply by looking at the bar chart  We will compare the length of the two uptrends next week after the one on the right has been fully extended 
On the hourly chart  we can see that the newly formed  steeper trendline has five contact points making it a very valid trend line  andwarning us to pay attention when it is broken  It also has five touch points on its top channel line plus one which went above it about half way through the trend  This gives us some good parameters to follow for each short term move  The one currently underway is close to thepreferredtop channel line  If we did not know that the next minor cycle low is due on Tuesday and that the move has almost reached its initial target  we could still expect some resistance to occur slightly above Friday s close which has the potential of turning the price back down 
On Thursday  the CCI dipped slightly into the red  but since it reversed immediately and had a good thrust into the green instead of giving a sell signal  it told us that the correction ended  The bottom indicator  A D plot  shows that the pattern of selling into first hour strength  which has been taking place for over a month  continues  I thought that it was an indication that large holders were selling into the opening strength in expectation of having reached the proximity of an important top but the market action has nullified this hypothesis 

An overview of some important indexes  daily charts 
Last week Apple  NASDAQ AAPL  was out of sync with the rest of the FAANGs  but until they all stop making new highs and show a propensity for correcting  it s likely that we are not yet ready for a significant market correction 
There was a little more uniformity in the lower tier with all four indexes failing to make new highs  but with the market expected to push higher next week  this may be only a head fake 

PowerShares DB US Dollar Bullish  NYSE UUP   dollar ETF 
Last week  UUP was buffeted by comments from the treasury secretary    who prefers a weak dollar    and the president    who nowlikes a strong dollar  The net result was that the dollar ended significantly lower probably on its way to eventually re test the 2011 low 

GDX  NYSE GDX   Gold miners ETF 
With the dollar taking a plunge  GDX made a new high but obediently stopped at a former resistance level  With its 6 wk cycle low due in just a few more days  it is likely that the current pull back will continue until then 

USO  United States Oil Fund  NYSE USO  
USO is most likely ready for a minor pull back  afterwhich it should push at least to 14 50 15 before undertaking a more protracted consolidation  Longer term  18 21 is not unconceivableand probably likely 

Summary
A new pattern of re accumulation has formed which projects higher prices over the near term "
"Jeffrey Gundlach s Outlook
Jeffrey Gundlach of DoubleLine Capital LP says the 10 year U S  Treasury note will likely trade in a range between 2 20 and 2 80 percent during the second half of the year  Gundlach also said U S  Treasuries are a buy for investors as they are yielding in the upper half of his projected trading range  He said this on June 10th of 2014 and it seems he still expects the 10 year yield to be lower than the 2 40  bottom put in about 3 weeks and 20 basis points ago  He runs primarily a bond fund  and he gets paid mainly on assets under management  so talking one s book to encourage more inflows into the fund is very important for his business model  Therefore  it is hard to know whether this is just  sales tactical speak  or he legitimately believes that the 10 year hasn t put in the bottom for not only this year but maybe for the next five to 10 years and beyond as many on Wall Street believe  
George Clooney Doesn t Need to Take Profits
However  if he generally is drinking the Bond Kool Aid  and who can blame him with all the craziness of central bank intervention  that means he didn t take profits when many did at the 2 40  lows  as the same day yields were back at 2 47   a 7 basis point move  and quickly moved another 25 basis points higher before settling back at the 2 60  level  If I were an investor in his fund I sure would have wanted him to take profits there  ahead of another robust jobs report  a Fed meeting announcing continued tapering and maybe more tightening  and strong GDP numbers for the second quarter coming soon

But again  Jeffrey Gundlach specializes in bonds so I am sure he knows best  But I would give him a friendly wager that the 10 year yield is higher than 2 80  over the next 6 months as our economy seems to be back end predisposed to growth within a given year based upon everything from back to school retail spending  holiday supply chain drivers and football season I believe Gundlach is focusing too much on European Bonds relativity to US Bonds  and as Bank of England Governor Mark Carney said last Thursday  U K  interest rates could rise sooner than investors expect  This is the same for US investors as the Fed could be forced to raise rates much sooner as Joseph LaVorgna  chief U S  economist for Deutsche Bank recently put the robust job growth this year in context  by pointing out that if we continue on this same pace of adding jobs to the economy  more jobs will be created in 2014 than in any year since 1999 
Context for the Doom and Gloom Crowd
This is an amazing fact when you consider that anybody who could fog up a mirror was hired in the tech bubble running up to 2000  For all those who focus on the slow growth in the housing sector right now  including Jeffrey Gundlach  remember that the jobs created this year are more than the 2003 2006 housing boom on an annual basis What Jeffrey fails to realize is that our economy has shifted from a housing based economy to a technology based economy  we are far healthier in the technology industry than we ever were in the 2000 boom era in technology  This fact is lost on a guy whose fund is based in California which seems even more short sighted in our opinion  Besides Apple  NASDAQ AAPL   Facebook  NASDAQ FB   and Google  NASDAQ GOOGL   even Intel  NASDAQ INTC   Microsoft  NASDAQ MSFT   and Hewlett Packard  NYSE HPQ  are showing some life with new leadership changes  We are on pace to create more jobs in this country than the tech glory days  the housing boom years  and the mortgage underwriting boom on a year over year comparison  and Gundlach thinks rates are going to stay below 2 80  for the second half of the year with the Fed exiting the bond market 
Joseph LaVorgna   Deutsche Bank Economic Forecast
Frankly there is a big difference between Europe and Japan on the one hand and England and the United States on the other  The latter will be raising rates sooner than investors currently have priced into their models  as Joseph LaVorgna states so succinctly   In six months  the unemployment rate will be below 6  and the core inflation rate will be at 2    he said   We are way ahead of schedule  We re going to get to 5 2  or 5 4  a year ahead of schedule   And that the  The Fed is behind the proverbial curve   and  The Fed should be raising rates  
Inflation Expectations to Rise in Europe
Frankly  when it comes to Europe  I think investors are just an example of the  inmates running the asylum  who wanted a bunch of free money from the ECB  Their inflation rate was still 0 5  by their measures and probably much higher in real terms  Markets influence the Central Banks these days and if they keep begging hard and long enough  eventually they force these weak central bank officials  hands within limits and have gotten their free capital  However  I think just as the Fed was raising the Fed Funds rate to 5 5  right before the financial crisis  the ECB decision on rates and other monetary stimulus measures is the last we will see for a long while  To be more specific  we have reached the end of the easing monetary cycle with the recent ECB fait accompli  and this sets the stage for the next tightening monetary cycle  This tightening monetary phase is upon us and will have to run its cyclical course  It will be at least 5 years in duration in our opinion  The Central Banks will be forced to pivot to the tightening cycle in order to combat rising inflation pressures At any rate  I expect Europe will be raising their equivalent to the Fed Funds Rate which currently stands at 15 basis points in 9 months  as they are more concerned with inflation levels than employment levels  and any uptick in measured European inflation freaks them out 
The Inflation Era
We think the inflation cycle is finally upon us even in official measurements that Central Banks focus on now that the wage part of the inflation puzzle is set to take off  as witnessed by Seattle s  15 minimum wage law which was recently enacted and these wage pressures start to push through to the rest of the country  Wages are finally going up in all areas  not just the upper spectrum of employment  We are officially in the wage inflation cycle  and tightening monetary policy is to follow as the Central Banks are forced to cut off the free money supply  It is now going to start costing investors to borrow money which is a healthy thing in our opinion 
Summary
In summary  we believe Jeffrey Gundlach is wrong regarding the 10 Year Bond yield staying below 2 80  over the second half of the year  as growth picks up and accelerates during the home stretch of 2014  We believe the Fed will be forced to raise rates before March 2015  Just like the Bank of England Governor Mark Carney s recent market warning  Janet Yellen will be sending her own market warning over the next six months  that she needs to move faster on rate hikes But that s what makes markets  For every buyer there is a seller  and we are definitely sellers of bonds at these levels  We believe that anything below 2 60  in yield on the 10 year over the next six months represents a positive expected value proposition from yield appreciation over this time period "
Wall Street continues to bleed as investors remain worried that the trade standoff between the United States and China could get much worse than before  While President Trump is now preparing to

Chinese video surveillance firm  Hikvision Lest we forget  the White House had added Huawei to its Entity List that includes companies that American firms can t sell technology to without obtaining a

"I hope last week s Iran head fake didn t have you thinking about buying so called  safe  dividends like Treasuries  Because these tired income standbys aren t safe at all 
With your nest egg yielding a pathetic 1 9   you re guaranteed losses  with inflation running at 2 1   So today we re going to make a simple contrarian move that will 
Hand us huge 8 6   cash dividends nearly five times what Treasuries pay   not every quarter Set us up for nice price gains  on the side   and  Give us  Iran insurance   helping shield our nest egg against swift drops triggered by global instability  an economic downturn any reason  really Because when it comes to income  the best defense is a good offense  so we re going to forge ahead as the world gets more uncertain and invest more of our cash outside America s shores  But don t worry  We re not going to abandon safe government bonds to do it 
I know what you re thinking   Brett  aren t other countries  bond yields even skimpier than those in the US  
That s true  for some countries  Heck  some even charge us to hold their debts  Swiss 10 year government bonds  for example  yield negative 0 59  today 
Our Shot at Safe 8 6  Dividends and Gains in an Uncertain World
Truth is  there are fewer places around the globe where you can grab any yield at all  But  funnily enough  this is exactly where our opportunity to bag 8 6   dividends comes in 
As negative rates spread  countries whose bonds boast positive yields especially those topping the paltry 1 9  on the US 10 year will likely see their bonds bid higher  driving their yields down in tandem 
One of these opportunities lies in Peru  where we can buy some government bonds yielding 8 75   And forget stories you hear about Peru being a basket case they re outdated  The government boasts one of the strongest balance sheets in Latin America  with a debt to GDP ratio of just 27  
By comparison  we re running a hot 106  in the US  Even Brazil  where investors are demanding 6 8  yields on 10 year bonds  does better  with public debt running around 80  of GDP 
If we didn t own the printing presses for the world s reserve currency  investors might demand higher coupon payments from us  too 
The opportunity here is obvious  But we re not going to hop a plane to Lima or Rio to grab it  We ll tap these payouts from the safety of our brokerage accounts 
What I m about to show you makes these 7   yields as easy to buy as Apple  NASDAQ AAPL  or Verizon  NYSE VZ   Better still  with just two buys  we ll diversify across government and corporate bonds and set ourselves up for nice price upside  too 
The key  Buying through   Let s talk about two foreign bond CEFs one focusing on government bonds and one on corporate bonds now 
Bond CEF No  1  8 6  Dividends From Sturdy Government Bonds
Grabbing these big overseas bond yields is a tricky job for us to do ourselves  so we want to  outsource  our buys to a seasoned pro  That s what we get in the First Trust Aberdeen Global Income Fund  FAM   with an 8 6  dividend paid monthly 
FAM  which holds bonds from both Brazil and Peru  is run by First Trust Asset Management  which boasts income focused CEFs in areas ranging from master limited partnerships  MLPs  and real estate to bonds and preferred stocks 
Thanks to First Trust s expertise it s been around since 1991 and access to cheap capital  FAM  like most CEFs  borrows to invest  a reasonable 29  of the portfolio is levered today   FAM s total return  based on market price  has more jumped 134  since inception 
FAM Rides to a Double






Note that this chart shows total returns  including dividends  This means that  because of FAM s massive payout  investors enjoyed this 134  return in cash  Which is a nice segue into what we can expect from FAM s payout in the future  more growth 
With the Federal Reserve now focused on cutting rates  more cash is likely to move abroad  driving up foreign bond prices as it does  That s helped balloon FAM s underlying portfolio  known in CEF speak as net asset value  or NAV   Check out FAM s NAV growth last year  as the Fed pivoted toward rate cuts 
Fed Cuts  FAM Cashes In






The fund  in turn  is handing its portfolio returns to shareholders in the form of higher payouts 
A Monthly 8 6  Dividend That Grows






Source  CEF Connect
With at least one more cut from the Fed likely this year  FAM is well positioned to keep growing its NAV  and dividend   Its 6 6  discount to NAV gives us a chance to buy in for 93 cents on the dollar 
Bond CEF No  2  An 8 6  Dividend for 10  Off

Finally  let s diversify into overseas corporate bonds with the Western Asset High Income Fund II  NYSE HIX  an 8 6  payer with a long history of strong performance 

HIX is run by  Legg Mason   NYSE LM   which has been in fixed income for 48 years  Since its inception in the late 1990s  HIX has returned 416   crushing the S P 500 
HIX  1  US Stocks  0






Legg Mason generates HIX s 8 6  payout through a portfolio that includes high yield corporate bonds  59 9    emerging market debt  22 2   about half of which is sovereign  the other half corporate bank loans  6 9   and investment grade corporate bonds  6 6   
As with FAM  we ve seen HIX s portfolio deliver a strong total return since early last year  when the Fed put rate cuts on the table 
 Powell Pivot  Powers HIX






As with FAM  HIX has been growing its payout  In December  it nudged it up to  0 0485 a share  from  0 047 in November and  0 045 a year ago Connect
The best news  Even with its big price gain  HIX trades at a 10  discount to NAV  suggesting more upside ahead 
My NEW CEF Pick Pays 8 3  Monthly  With Upside  Get It Here 
I just released my best pick among foreign bond funds a stout 8 3  payer that has plenty of price upside no matter what happens with Iran  the Fed or the global economy 
This incredible fund boasts high yield government bonds backed by countries with solid balance sheets  And it holds a lot of bonds  too 290  to be exact  So if a few do happen to run into trouble  we don t have to worry  it won t sideswipe the fund s entire portfolio 
This new pick yields 8 3  today and pays you every single month 
I know that sounds similar to FAM  the government bond CEF I mentioned above  But there are two critical differences  starting with performance my pick has crushed FAM since the latter s inception in 2004
New Pick Crushes the Competition






But despite that outperformance  this big dividend is cheaper than FAM  trading at a ridiculous 8 2  discount to NAV as I write this  compared to 5 4  for FAM 
That sets the table for even more upside  Throw in a Fed likely to cut rates and I m calling for 15   price gains for my latest pick in the next 12 months in addition to its fat 8 3  monthly payout 
The full story on this breakthrough pick name  ticker  buy under price and my complete analysis is in the just released issue of Contrarian Income Report  which I ll give you instant access to  
That s not all 
I ll also give you   It s a collection of top quality funds and stocks REITs  US stocks  preferred stocks  closed end funds  you name it that investors too often ignore in their quest for yield 
Taken together  this carefully calibrated portfolio pays you 8  dividends every single month  with price upside  to boot

"The steel industry has staged a recovery after being out of favor for long  Improving steel prices  favorable developments on trade cases and expectations of significant infrastructure spending under the Trump administration are among the key factors that have put the wind back into the sails of the steel industry Sustained recovery in developed economies and continued growth in emerging economies are expected to help keep the steel industry on a positive growth path in 2017 The World Steel Association expects global steel demand to expand 1 3  in 2017 after a 1  rise last year  The United States is expected to continue to lead growth in the developed world thanks to strong fundamentals  newly announced measures related to fiscal stimuli and rising infrastructure spending  Steel demand in the United States is expected to rise 3  this year The Eurozone economy has also gained traction of late  as evident from a slew of upbeat economic data that suggest a recovery is steadily firming in the region  Steel demand in the European Union is expected to go up 0 5  in 2017  Demand in emerging and developing economies  barring China  is also expected to rise 4  this year The  has outperformed the broader market in a year s time  The industry has gained around 32 5  in this period  higher than the S P 500 s corresponding return of around 12 6

positioning calls for some more upside moving ahead Let s take a look into some of the factors that have contributed to a rebound in the steel space Trade Actions on ImportsOne of the major factors that have fueled a recovery in the steel sector is favorable developments on a number of trade cases that led to a decline in steel imports  Affirmative rulings in these cases have been be a positive catalyst for the U S  steel industry Steel imports fell around 15  year over year in 2016 on the back of punitive trade actions  Notably  positive rulings in trade cases  resulting in levy of heavy tariffs  against China last year led to a decline in Chinese steel exports to the United States Chinese steel exports fell significantly in the first eight months of 2017  Steel exports from the country went down 28 5  year over year to 54 47 million tons during this timeframe  per customs data The Trump administration s aggressive trade policies are also expected to provide more protection to the U S  steel industry  Steel stocks got a big lift in April 2017 after the Trump administration ordered an investigation under Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962  The Section 232 probe is aimed at determining whether the imports pose a threat to national security and also gives the President the power to impose broad tariffs or quotas on imported steel While the findings from the Section 232 steel investigation are due  it goes without saying that a positive outcome from the probe will provide a major thrust to American steel makers Recovery in Steel PricesSteel makers are also gaining from a recovery in steel prices  Steel prices have rebounded on the back of trade actions  reflected by a significant increase in hot rolled and cold rolled steel prices  Higher costs of steel making inputs such as iron ore and coking coal have contributed to a recovery in prices  A number of steel companies inlcuding AK Steel Holding Corp    NYSE AKS   and United States Steel Corp    NYSE X   have been raising their steel selling prices in response to an increase in raw material costs China s actions to reduce its excess steel supply are also expected to lend support to steel prices in 2017  The world s largest steel producer has pledged to cut its steel production capacity by around 50 million metric tons in 2017 Moreover  should the findings under the Section 232 investigation come positive  the Trump administration will get the opportunity to take broad based trade actions against cheap imports  This would provide a significant boost to steel prices     Trump s Spending BoostSteel stocks  which were in the dumps for the most part of 2016  got a shot in the arm following Donald Trump s win in November on expectations of significant infrastructure spending under him The president s call for the massive infrastructure spending is likely to have a beneficial effect on the steel industry given the expected increase in steel demand as steel is a key component in many infrastructure products  Trump s  big  spending plans have thus painted a bullish picture for steel companies Strength in Major End MarketsContinued momentum in the automotive space and a recovery across housing and commercial construction markets have been other key tailwinds for the steel industry  The automotive and construction industries will continue to provide the backbone to the steel industry The automotive sector continues its healthy run  backed by an improving job market  rising personal income  low fuel prices and attractive financing options  Moreover  positives like an improving economy  healthy job growth  steady buyer demand  positive consumer confidence and a tight supply situation raise optimism about the housing and construction sector s performance 3

"By Julia Love  Reuters    As Apple Inc  O AAPL  feuds with the U S  government over iPhone privacy protections  the tech giant is also grappling with internal conflicts over privacy that could pose challenges to its long term product strategy  Unlike Google  O GOOGL   Amazon  O AMZN  and Facebook  O FB   Apple is loathe to use customer data to deliver targeted advertising or personalized recommendations  Indeed  any collection of Apple customer data requires sign off from a committee of three  privacy czars  and a top executive  according to four former employees who worked on a variety of products that went through privacy vetting  Approval is anything but automatic  products including the Siri voice command feature and the recently scaled back iAd advertising network were restricted over privacy concerns  these people said  Many employees take pride in Apple s stance  and CEO Tim Cook has called it a matter of principle    Customers expect Apple and other technology companies to do everything in our power to protect their personal information   Cook wrote in a letter explaining the company s opposition to a government demand that it help unlock the iPhone of one of the shooters in the December attacks in San Bernardino  California  Such policies also have a business rationale  Apple s apparent willingness to sacrifice some profit for the sake of privacy bolsters its image as a company that protects customers   It s an easier stand for Apple to take than  say  Facebook or Amazon   Apple s chief business to date has been selling devices rather than advertising or e commerce   But now  amid stagnant iPhone sales  Apple executives have flagged services such as iCloud and Apple Music as prime sources for growth   which could test the company s commitment to limiting the use of personal data  Apple declined to comment for this story   THE CZARS Inside Apple  the trio of experts known among employees as the privacy czars are both admired and feared  Jane Horvath  a lawyer who previously served as global privacy counsel at Google  is the group s legal and policy wonk  often channeling the views of Apple s board and citing regulatory requirements  said former employees who have worked with her  She was hired to formalize privacy practices after the 2011  locationgate  scandal  in which iPhones were found to be gathering information about users  whereabouts  Horvath works alongside Guy  Bud  Tribble  a member of the original Macintosh team who is venerated by employees as one of the few who  had been to the mountain with Moses   as one former employee put it  referring to Tribble s ties to the late Steve Jobs  Tribble has broad responsibilities as vice president of software technology  but he devotes substantial time to privacy  often working with closely with engineers  The meetings can be tense  but Tribble s skill and easy personality make him a popular figure  people who have worked with him said   The third czar  a rising star named Erik Neuenschwander  scrutinizes engineers  work to ensure they are following through on the agreements   even reviewing lines of code  Following a popular philosophy in Silicon Valley known as  privacy by design   product managers start collaborating early with the privacy engineering and legal teams  former Apple employees said  For complicated matters  the privacy taskforce steers the issue to a senior vice president  and particularly sensitive questions may rise to Cook  Key principles include keeping customer data on their devices   rather than in the cloud  on Apple servers   and isolating various types of data so they cannot be united to form profiles of customers   Such privacy guidelines can cut against engineers  instincts to  collect all the data  because sometime down the road it may be useful   said Albert Gidari  director of privacy at Stanford University s Center for Internet and Society  Debates over new uses of data at Apple typically take at least a month and have dragged on for more than a year  former employees said   Most tech companies now have privacy review processes  Facebook  Google  Twitter  NYSE TWTR  and Snapchat entered into consent orders with the Federal Trade Commission that require them   At Facebook and Google  the privacy teams also insert themselves early and often in product development  spokesmen for the companies said  A spokesperson for Amazon declined comment  The consensus among privacy experts is that privacy enforcement is more stringent at Apple because of the company s business model   Some of the data intensive companies have very rich privacy practices   said Deirdre Mulligan  an associate professor at UC Berkeley who studies privacy  But  there s a lot more negotiating and disagreement than you might find in a company that is not trying to make their money off data   ADVERTISING WOES The biggest casualty of Apple s privacy stance may be iAd  a service launched in 2010 that aimed to deliver ads inside iPhone apps  with revenue to be split between Apple and app developers  Although Apple was a late entrant  it had a tantalizing asset  iTunes  one of the industry s richest troves of consumer data   That database  however  was off limits  Whenever employees wanted to use iTunes data to sharpen targeting  they had to appeal to the privacy team  according to two former Apple employees who worked on iAd   The iAd team fought hard to give advertisers greater visibility into who saw their ads  those employees said  Their hope was to create anonymous identifiers so advertisers could discern which users had seen their ads   But despite about a dozen similar pitches  the most executives would allow was a count of how many users had seen an advertisement  according to the former employees   It was so watered down  it wasn t even useful   one of the former employees said  As a result  iAd struggled to entice advertisers  who will pay a premium for detailed data on their customers  In January  Apple announced it would discontinue the iAd app network   We always heard from the iAd team that they would love to get more data to help them optimize campaigns for marketers  and that was sometimes difficult   said Peter Hamilton  CEO of TUNE  a popular mobile marketing platform  which worked with marketers on iAd campaigns   CULTURE CLASH In other cases  Apple s privacy stance forced tough workarounds  Siri  a company Apple acquired in 2010  was the foundation for the voice controlled digital assistant built into the iPhone the following year  But during the integration  privacy leaders insisted that voice data on what users say to Siri should be stored separately from personally identifiable information  according to a former Apple employee who attended some of the meetings    That was a major back end surgery   the former employee said   During an update of the Spotlight search feature for the 2014 edition of Mac software  the privacy and engineering teams had to work closely to come up with a way to keep users  search logs on Apple servers that would give engineers the data they wanted without raising privacy concerns    The obvious reaction I d have as a data person is   This is insane    said a former employee who worked on the project  But the experience also underscored the extent of the company s commitment to protect consumer data  the former employee said  Apple must strike the right balance as it intensifies its push into services  said Bob O Donnell  an analyst with TECHnalysis Research  In January  Apple s earnings report showed  5 5 billion in services revenue for the most recent quarter  up 15 percent from the previous year   
 The value of a service is the ability to personalize it   O Donnell said   The only way you can personalize it is with knowledge about an individual s preferences  "
"The retail sector is today dominated by Amazon  AMZN   which is proving a tough match for traditional retailers  With market share growing for Amazon Prime  Marketplace and Prime Air  as well as the launch of drone delivery  Amazon is poised for exceptional growth  So much so  that Amazon is a threat to most retailers scouring for options to stay in business Best Buy  BBY  has adopted speedy fulfillment by shipping directly from its stores  Moreover  retailers like Macy s  M   Target  TGT  and Home Depot  NYSE HD   HD  have opted ship from store to cut down on transportation costs  On the other hand  Nike  NYSE NKE   NKE  and V F  Corp s  VFC  North Face brand have come up with an innovation to use artificial intelligence to help shoppers find and customize products online  Likewise  retailing giant Wal Mart  WMT  has been gaining from increased sales of groceries online for more than a decade  However  Wal Mart s success is also at stake here  with Amazon expanding in the grocery business Another concern stemming from Amazon s success story is that retail sector is struggling with lower footfall at stores as all the brands are looking to directly sell to consumers through the expansion of digital stores  This apart  retailers are making strides to enhance mobile experiences through the launch of mobile apps  while also improving the checkout process with mobile wallets like PayPal and Apple  NASDAQ AAPL  Pay Additionally  players in the sector have also been hit hard by major economic challenges like a strong U S  dollar  volatile commodity costs and global uncertainty  The volatility in U S  dollar has been hurting retailers for quite some time now with worldwide operations While retailers are leaving no stone unturned to stay in the game  it remains to be seen if they really have solutions to their Amazon problems This clearly shows that the Retail Wholesale sector is no longer a bed of roses  Some issues troubling the retail industry are elaborated below Online vs  Offline  The rise of omni channel retailing has heightened consumer expectations and simultaneously problems for retailers  Today  retailers must provide a blend of online and offline experience to engage customers  Moreover  along with an impressive product assortment  pricing  shipping  returns and promotional offerings  it is necessary to introduce personalized customer services in order to satisfy consumers Further  there are other challenges in the brick and mortar store format that need individual attention  like deciding a store layout  fixing places for products and promotions  and a quick test of ideas to arrive at the best decision and implement it across multiple stores  However  fixing problems in the online world is easier as data expedites the process of finding problems and solutions  and engineers solve the same in no time  
Also  the overhead cost of operating a physical store is a lot higher than that of managing a website  Hence  online retailers sell products at lower costs  While physical stores indulge in lowering prices to match up  this can ultimately weigh on their bottom lines Looking at the other side of the coin  pure play online retailers also face challenges in converting a browsing customer into a buyer  Additionally  these companies incur huge logistics costs in shipping products to customers as well as returns New Payment Systems   Mobile Payment Solutions  With an increase in point of sale  POS  systems and online transactions  there has been a significant rise in the number of data breaches  which have heightened concerns regarding the security of consumers  personal data  As a result  retailers have introduced EMV cards and renovated their POS systems to accept various payment options including chip and pin cards  magnetic stripe cards and NRF payments Further  there has been tremendous growth in mobile payment solutions including tap and pay or mobile wallets  It is clear that customers prefer to pay with cards or by using their mobile  So  retailers missing out on these payment options may end up being laggards  It has thus become necessary for retailers to adopt mobile payment solutions that suit them  from mobile POS systems  customized mobile payment apps like the Kohl s Pay  and third party solutions like Apple s Apple Pay  Speaking of third party options other noteworthy options are Android Pay and Samsung  KS 005930  Pay  which are expanding globally Customer Experience Personalization  Today  customers are well informed  thanks to increased access to online portals that provide every detail regarding products  ranging from price to reviews  This  along with the fact that every product has some or other alternative  makes it difficult for store personnel to convert an in store sale  
Additionally  customers now have high expectations as they want the best product at a reasonable price  assured availability  speedy delivery and more  Moreover  customers look for a more personalized shopping experience that they can connect with Well  here we can give the example of Nike  which has been offering personalized services like customized sneakers on customer request and the like  However  this kind of personalization is not possible for smaller firms  which can otherwise bank on ideas like targeting customers with a product tailored according to their preferences based on past purchases  or using location based technology such as beacons to push personalized offers to customers  mobile devices  These tactics may aid in satisfying customers  sky high expectations A Highly Promotional Environment  The retail industry is highly competitive  To counter competition  retailers resort to excessive and often unplanned promotions that can largely impact sales and erode margins  In the past  this was common during the holiday season  when retailers proffered huge discounts and offers to meet short term top line targets and steal share from competitors  
However  now we are in the world of constant commerce  which requires lucrative offers not matter how  when and on what one shops  In general  the increased use of such promotions comes at a price  usually strained margins  especially as consumers today are unwilling to pay the full price for products Maintaining Efficient Workforce  In the retail industry  where a salesperson is more like an asset than staff  recruiting disciplined workforce and maintaining productivity is very difficult  Retailers generally find it challenging to spot good staff in the first place  and even if they succeed in the process  retaining them becomes tedious Further  an improving economy has opened up more employment options and hence the pressure of maintaining a pleasant work environment with competitive wages and scheduling is high Efficient Supply Chain Management  This involves ensuring that the products reach stores on time  Maintaining an efficient flow has been a major challenge for retailers as disruption in supply of products due to miscommunication  changes in requirements or any unavoidable situation is common  This roils retailers  business with empty racks and costs dollars  
An example of this situation is when a customer sees empty shelves after a promotional advertisement  While the customer will only be disappointed on not receiving the product  the retailer will be penalized for such an act and not be allowed to run the promotion further despite all the money spent on the advertisement Bottom LineAs you can see  survival is tough in the evolving retail space  particularly as Amazon steals the majority of market share  However  retailers vying to stay on should be ready to cover the shortcomings and treat the threats as opportunities In a nutshell  online retailing is a major growth driver in the retail industry  Retailers that balance physical and online presence are here to stay  Altogether  retailers providing frictionless shopping experience  online or in stores  with seamless payment solutions are likely to stay in the market  On the other hand  retailers that have been slow to invest and still relying on traditional marketing methods are bound to suffer   Check out our latest  for more on the current state of affairs in this market from an earnings perspective  and how the trend is looking for this important sector of the economy now "
"Between escalating tensions with North Korea and a U S  Congress in gridlock  it can sometimes be challenging to stay positive  That s why I m pleased to share with you this good news  Our  was up more than 45 percent for the 12 month period as of September 22  2017  beating its benchmark  the Hang Seng Comp I  which gained 20 7 percent over the same period  This means USCOX outperformed the index by roughly 25 percent 
Put another way  USCOX has beaten the HSCI in eight of the past 11 months  or 73 percent of the time  with the greatest monthly spread between fund and index occurring in June 
One of the main contributors to our outperformance is our overweight positions in  which made up a combined 61 percent of the fund as of September 22  As we see it  these sectors are where the growth is  driven by innovative tech firms  from Sunny Optical to Tencent Holdings Ltd  HK 0700   and automakers such as Geely Automative  Guangzhou Automobile Group Co Ltd  HK 2238  and Great Wall Motor Company Ltd  OTC GWLLY  

Asian Stocks Look Cheap Compared to the American and European Markets When measured against the American and European markets  Asian stocks  excluding Japan  have been the top performers of 2017 so far  returning more than 30 percent year to date  That s compared to an 11 7 percent gain for the S P 500 Index and 20 percent gain for the STOXX 600 
Asian stocks also have a more attractive valuation than these other two regions  With the S P 500 trading at 21 4 times earnings and the STOXX Europe 600 trading at 21 2 times earnings  the MSCI All Country Asia Pacific ex Japan Index looks more reasonable at 15 6 times earnings  The  meanwhile  trades at 15 5 times earnings  making it  I believe  an exceptional value 
Cars  Tech and Sportswear Driving Growth We believe our exposure to Chinese automakers and tech firms makes USCOX well positioned for long term growth  Not only is China the largest passenger car market in the world  it was also the fastest growing  In the first eight months of this year  auto sales in the country were up close to 5 percent compared to the same eight months in 2016  according to the China Association of Automobile Manufacturers  Geely  which completed its acquisition of Volkswagen  DE VOWG p  in 2010  sold 718 000 vehicles during this period  an amazing 88 percent increase year over year 
Tech manufacturers  especially those that supply Apple Inc  NASDAQ AAPL   look very attractive  Our favorite right now is Sunny Optical  which specializes in lenses for a number of advanced applications  The company announced that shipments of handset lenses surged 96 percent in August  while vehicle lenses rose 65 percent  For the 12 month period as of September 22  its stock was up 264 percent 
We re also fans of ANTA Sports Products Ltd  HK 2020   China s largest sportswear company by revenue  By selling pricier athletic gear under its Fila brand  the company is seeking to capitalize on rising incomes and the Chinese government s push to boost participation in sports  According to Bloomberg  the government aims for 435 million of its citizens  a third of its population  to work out more frequently by 2020  This bodes well for Anta

beat earnings expectations  primarily on robust sales of Opdivo and Eliquis  We are also encouraged by Bristol Myers  efforts to develop its pipeline  especially Opdivo  Several label expansion applications for Opdivo are under review in the United States and Europe  These  if approved  will further boost the prospects of this blockbuster drug  However  failure of the drug and withdrawal of

T2108 Status  45 9 VIX Status  14 2General  Short term  Trading Call  Hold  1 day trade is to short SPY based on the T2108 2 Day Decline Model  See below for more details Commentary I am FINALLY ready to announce a new beginning for T2108  On Tuesday night  I presented my final project in my data mining and machine learning course  using R as the programming platform   a project based on an analysis of T2108  I am now ready to start rolling out my results and methods  This remains a work in progress as I have already written up nearly a page of things I would like to do  try  and enhance  Thus  I will not yet publish my project until I feel I have addressed several additional modeling questions and done even more thorough data investigations  However  if you would like to see the presentation anyway  I will email it to you if you would kindly agree to send me feedback   Go to  to send me a message   I had one major objective  use data mining techniques to develop a more rigorous definition of oversold and overbought conditions  I produced some encouraging results but not yet as conclusive as I would like  20  still works OK as a threshold for oversold and 70  is adequate as a threshold for overbought  but other threshold levels hold very interesting properties as well  like 40  on the downside and 75  to the upside  that produce relatively reliable predictions for short term trades on the S P 500  Also  the switching behavior I have noted for overbought periods   where the odds switch from the bears to the bulls once the duration hits around 20 days   is a common characteristic for many thresholds  After seeing these characteristics  I decided that the concept of oversold and overbought may be too narrow for how to interpret the crossing of threshold levels  Stay tuned on this  A fortuitous objective appeared after the first few weeks of the class  Recall in mid February   I predicted a bounce  and  voila  it happened  That event launched me into an early investigation using data mining to see whether 2 day declines in T2108 could meaningfully predict whether or not the S P 500 would trade up or down the next day    and not quite correct given a very small flaw I found in my data    I have now developed the model enough to make predictions  T2108 declined 17 8  on Tuesday and has declined  18 4  over two days  Using tuned decision trees  classification   my model concludes that Thursday will be a down day for the S P 500 with a 74  likelihood  Yes  this took my aback as well since I was hoping for more consistent behavior of bouncing after steep declines  But many factors are at work shaping this prediction  and it seems the VIX did not increase enough to generate an up prediction   The error rate for this model is also better for down predictions than up predictions   Note well that I am not predicting the magnitude of the down day  The different machine learning models I tried were terrible at predicting the magnitude of the decline  and I expected this behavior  The predictors I used in the model do not suggest that they can have anything to say about magnitude  The decision tree for this prediction is extremely deep  too deep    and this is an area where I need to play around with modeling parameters to find the right balance between simplicity of the tree and prediction accuracy  or from a trading perspective  prediction utility  that is  the usefulness of the prediction   For example  the decision tree used to make the prediction for Thursday  April 4th s  trade is as follows  all quantities are based on April 3rd s closing trade   The VIX changes by more than   68  and the VIX changes by less than 18 5  and T2108 closes at 34 4 or higher  traverses three branches deep  and T2108 s 1 day change is greater than  19 5   traverses two branches deep  and the S P 500 is above its 50DMA and FINALLY  the VIX changes by more than 5 5   which was already established at the top of the tree   whew   Note that unlike my preliminary conclusions  the VIX CAN matter in these predictions  It is just not a consistent predictor  In this case  a VIX change ABOVE 18 5  would have led immediately to the terminal conclusion that the S P 500 is likely to close up on Thursday  These kinds of deep trees are not amenable to easy trading rules  I have an important goal to generate the simplest T2108 trading rules possible without sacrificing too much effectiveness  In the meantime  I will run the model to produce the predictions and report the results here  One to do is to get more familiar with the model s sensitivity to the data used to construct it  that was an early lesson from February    For example  the trees I am currently building will change depending on the magnitude of the 2 day decline in T2108  If none of that made any sense to you  then you are definitely someone who needs to ask clarifying questions below  If this made perfect sense to you  and you are shaking your head in horror at my methods  then you especially should be writing your critique below  I am looking forward to all feedback on this  living  project  Now  back to the usual programming  T2108 s sharp decline took it to a new low for the year  We last saw these levels right after Thanksgiving as the S P 500 was starting a post election recovery  The S P 500 fell from all time highs for a 1 1  loss  It also broke the primary uptrend at the 20DMA for the first time since mid February  when it hit a quasi oversold level   The VIX popped but STILL remains under critical resistance around 15 4  It did not even touch a new high for the area of churn that has dominated the VIX for the past several weeks On twitter  I have been tweeting several warning signs  I have had some false positives earlier  but the bearish technical evidence just keeps mounting  including Apple  AAPL  unable to sustain its breakout above its 50DMA and trading significantly lower just as the S P 500 hit the all time high last Thursday Caterpillar  CAT  continues to sink ever lower  Never a good sign when cyclicals are in retreat  CAT is now DOWN for the year and off its 2013 peak by over 17  A bearish divergence developed on Tuesday after the S P 500 traded right to the all time high  but T2108 surprisingly closed down slightly Finally  today s mini breakdown on the S P 500 was confirmed early by weakness in the Australian dollar against the U S  dollar  FXA  While none of these bearish indicators are necessary to raise the red flag  they are sufficient to do so  As I type  the Bank of Japan  BoJ  has added intrigue to tomorrow s session that will also follow decisions by the central banks in Europe and the United Kingdom  On Friday  the U S  will roll out another employment report  In other words  there will be PLENTY of fundamental news to give bulls and bears excuses for pulling quick triggers  The T2108 models will not be listening to any of it Black line  T2108  measured on the right   Green line  S P 500  for comparative purposes Red line  T2108 Overbought  70    Blue line  T2108 Oversold  20  Full disclosure  long VXX shares and puts  long CAT shares and

"WASHINGTON  Reuters    The escalating trade war between the United States and China has gone beyond tariffs as the countries increase pressure on each other to cede ground  Beijing has said it would retaliate after President Donald Trump blacklisted Chinese telecom giant Huawei and the United States extended tariffs to cover almost all Chinese imports       Chinese state media has warned that Beijing could use rare earths for its next strike in the trade war  The United States relies on China for supplies of the rare earths to make a host of high tech products  from satellites to electric car batteries  Here are some other possible pressure points for each side  POTENTIAL CHINESE RESPONSES HIKING TARIFFS FURTHER  China could impose tariffs on around  10 billion of U S  goods that as yet carry no retaliatory tariffs   Beijing removed some tariffs on U S  car imports in December  and could reimpose them  China could raise tariffs from 25 percent on some U S  goods such as soybeans  China was the top U S  buyer of soybeans until the trade war  which came close to halting the flow altogether  If it raises tariffs again  Chinese soy importers will seek more supplies from Brazil and elsewhere  as they did in 2018  which would hurt U S  farmers  These are targeted tariffs  aimed at the U S  farming community that supported Trump s 2016 presidential election victory  High tech items  such as semi conductor manufacturing equipment and chips  would be unlikely to feature on a list for higher tariffs  because China cannot easily find alternatives  China has so far spared Boeing  NYSE BA  passenger jets  its single most valuable U S  import  from tariffs  Chinese carriers are expanding rapidly to meet rising demand  so tariffs on Boeing could slow development of the domestic travel industry  China could buy more aircraft from France s Airbus instead of Boeing  which would make it more reliant on Europe for a few years until it completes development of homegrown commercial aircraft  COMAC s C919           DUMPING TREASURIES China is the biggest holder of U S  government debt  with about  1 12 trillion in U S  Treasuries  Beijing buys Treasuries as a safe haven for foreign exchange reserves  The editor in chief of China s influential Global Times tweeted in May that  many Chinese scholars are discussing the possibility of dumping U S  Treasuries and how to do it specifically   A selloff would hurt U S  markets  driving up interest rates and pushing up borrowing costs  The U S  central bank could lower its benchmark interest rate or buy debt to counter the move  China sold the most long dated U S  Treasuries in almost 2 1 2 years in March  But most China experts say Beijing is unlikely to undertake a big selloff because that would lower the value of China s foreign exchange reserves  The Chinese would be hard pressed to find a safe alternative investment with a good yield       DEVALUATION Some analysts have floated the idea of a one off devaluation of the Chinese currency to make the country s exports more competitive despite U S  tariffs  But that would spook foreign and domestic investors and give the United States ammunition to sanction the country for currency manipulation   That is not retaliation  That is escalation of the trade war   said Gary Hufbauer  a senior fellow and trade expert at the Peterson Institute for International Economics   The Chinese currency has weakened nearly 4 percent since July 2018  when U S  authorities began collecting the first China specific tariffs  That has absorbed some of the impact of tariffs on Chinese exporters  HARASSING U S  COMPANIES OR SLOWING VISA APPROVALS China s Commerce Ministry said on Friday it will draft a list of foreign companies  organizations and individuals that it deems  unreliable  for harming Chinese companies  state run China National Radio reported  The move does not single out any countries or companies  but the report cited a ministry spokesman as saying the  unreliable entities list  will apply to those that flout market rules and the spirit of contracts  block supplies to Chinese companies for non commercial reasons and  seriously harm the legitimate rights and interests  of Chinese companies  China could target high profile U S  companies such as Apple  NASDAQ AAPL   although that could backfire as millions of Chinese people depend on the tech firm for their jobs  Goldman Sachs  NYSE GS  estimates that banning Apple products could slash profits of the iPhone maker by almost a third  Apple and other U S  firms are also vulnerable to consumer boycotts in China  There is precedent for this  South Korean companies faced boycotts when deployment of a U S  anti missile system angered China s government  Beijing could make life difficult for American banks  restaurant chains such as Starbucks  NASDAQ SBUX   courier companies such as Fedex and commodity suppliers by opening tax inquiries  withholding licenses and other similar bureaucratic moves  Big U S  businesses  however  have been among those pushing for a more moderate stance in Washington  so it would not help Beijing s case to alienate them  Many American brands in China have joint ventures with Chinese partners  and these would also be hurt by government pressure  Both sides have already slowed visa approvals for academics  authorities could do the same for executives and government officials   DIPLOMATIC RECALCITRANCE AND MILITARY POSTURING Beijing could reduce cooperation with the United States on thorny international issues  such as North Korea and Iran  It could also step up military gestures in the South China Sea and around Taiwan  an unofficial U S  ally   RARE EARTH METALS  President Xi Jinping visited a rare earth firm in Southern  NYSE SO  China earlier in May  fueling speculation China could cut off supplies of the metals  a key ingredient in high technology consumer electronics and military equipment  to the United States as part of the trade war  China supplies 80  of U S  rare earths  U S  RETALIATION AGAINST CHINA HIGHER TARIFFS  The United States could increase tariffs on Chinese imports  Authority for that rests with Trump  who has described himself as tariff man      One option would be to raise levies on  50 billion worth of Chinese technology goods  including machinery  semiconductors  autos aircraft parts and intermediate electronic components on which tariffs were imposed last July and August  The products  taxed at a 25  rate  were selected to avoid hitting U S  consumers and to hamper China s technology development  SANCTIONS AGAINST SPECIFIC COMPANIES The United States could sanction additional Chinese companies flagged for a host of issues  from alleged intellectual property theft to sanctions violations or human rights concerns  One option would be placing more companies on a blacklist that bars U S  suppliers from selling to them without special permits  as the Trump administration did with Huawei Technologies last month   Washington is already considering sanctions for Chinese video surveillance firm Hikvision and equipment maker Zhejiang Dahua Technology  They are involved in surveillance at Chinese detention centers for ethnic Uighurs and other Muslims    The downside would be hurting U S  companies that do business with the targeted firm  Administration officials could further increase pressure on foreign governments to exclude Huawei from their 5G networks       JUSTICE DEPARTMENT CRACKDOWN The Justice Department is likely to continue to crack down on Chinese spies and hackers for stealing technology and trade secrets from American corporations  as part of its China initiative to counter Chinese economic and security threats            FOREIGN POLICY AND DEFENSE LEVERS   Tension has already risen as the United States undertakes freedom of navigation operations through the Taiwan Strait and South China Sea  China has been increasingly assertive about its sovereignty over Taiwan  which it considers Chinese territory to be brought under Beijing s control by force if needed  U S  warships have sailed through the Taiwan Strait at least once a month since the start of this year  The United States restarted such missions on a regular basis last July       Trump s government could impose sanctions on prominent Chinese officials seen as complicit in human rights violations of the Uighur population  Congress has urged Trump to impose such sanctions  
    Washington could also deepen a crackdown on Chinese companies that fund or supply North Korea s nuclear programs "

The stock market is overvalued  Price to earnings ratios are too high  Investors are too complacent  the volatility index is still below historic average  The Federal Reserve isn t just planning to raise interest rates but plotting a reduction of its  4 5 trillion balance sheet  which can add to the effect of monetary policy tightening  further increasing borrowing costs 
All good reasons why the stock market could collapse  Instead the Dow Industrial Average has the best single day of trading since April  Here is the key point  the thing that really does matter the trend is up  The trend has been up for 8 years  A trend in place is more likely to continue than it is to reverse 
A trend can keep going for a long  long time  At some point  the trend will indeed reverse but that was not the case today  The market has slogged along the past 2 weeks with a minor pullback  yesterday we called that a pause and sure enough  today the market hit the play button  but we have not seen anything yet to confirm a trend reversal 
Individual stocks may have already reversed but the major bull market trend remains in place 
Markets do not go up in a straight line  they fluctuate  It may seem totally irrational that the market can keep rolling along like this but the market can remain irrational far longer than individual investors can remain solvent  That does not mean that we should disregard the recent pullback 
The recent declines should remind us that the relentless bull market will not last forever  When that fateful day finally comes and stocks begin their painful unwind  will you be ready  Probably not  Just as you develop a plan for what and when to buy  you should also have a plan for when to sell 
Maybe you are in it for the short term or the long term  Maybe you can handle 5  risk  or 10  or 20   Whatever your plan  make sure you have a plan and that you stick to it 
The holy grail of successful investing is not buying momentum stocks in an uptrend  it is not investing in a bull market when stocks pull back  The holy grail is discipline  A good plan  executed with discipline will beat a brilliant plan with no discipline

Markets Surge After French Election
I m not surprised that global markets are on a tear following independent centrist candidate Emmanuel Macron s sweeping victory in the first round of French presidential elections  The CAC broke through a nine year high on Monday to close at 5 268 85  while Germany s DAX shot through to all time highs and settled at 12 454 98 
Macron is promising to give away everything but the kitchen sink 
Scratch that  including the kitchen sink 
  Macron wants to bail out France  Greece  and anybody with a pulse  practically speaking  As part of that  he wants to reinforce EU commitments and the euro 
In other words  his victory implies more spending  more stimulus  and more handouts  And that  in turn  implies higher stock prices ahead 
Naturally the doom and gloom crowd is out in force 
  stocks are expensive
  what goes up must go down
  primed for a crash
  Trump this  Pence that
  the Fed  the ECB
  North Korea  Russia

Putting more money to work is exactly what savvy investors should be doing 
Things were much the same in 1999 and again in 2007  when legions of folks believed the run was over  that stocks were  expensive   and that there was  nothing to buy  
I wouldn t hold it against you if you wanted to head for the hills or bury your head in the sand like an ostrich with a sign on your rear end saying  kick me when it s over   Just make sure you understand the irony of your actions if you do 
To borrow an old expression  the more things change  the more they stay the same 
What I want you to understand today is that there is no more difficult time to invest than in a market that s doing very well for the hesitant or the uncertain 
The Most Successful Company in the World Was Once  Too Expensive 
Take Altria Group  NYSE MO  Inc   NYSE     for example 
The company was trading at or near all time highs of  53 per share 19 years ago  which made it very  expensive  compared to other stocks  At the same time  legions of investors caught up in the excitement of the dot com era found it boring   Like watching paint dry  was a characterization I heard more than once from dollar struck people enamored with the likes of Pets com and Webvan 
Yet  Altria had a rock solid business model and was tapped into the Unstoppable Trends we follow day in and day out around here 
Not only did this give the company huge profit potential  but it gave those very same investors the thing they craved most   the potential for huge returns  high current income  and stability 
Since then  the stock has returned 1 691 62   earnings have grown by 1 712   and yield is still a rock solid 3 3  that s grown by 58   So much for the ole things are expensive argument  don t you think 
Today  I hear shades of the same thinking from thousands of concerned investors  especially when it comes to the big tech companies we talk about frequently 
For example  Amazon trades at a PE of 185  and Facebook trades at a PE of 42  By conventional metrics  both are extremely expensive 
Only neither is a conventional company  which is why conventional metrics often used to judge overall market conditions and the relative attractiveness of specific stocks don t apply  Research  in fact  shows that PE ratios have very little predictive value when it comes to identifying the most successful investments 
For that  you ve got to look forward to a company s products  to its competitive position  and to its customers 
Both of these companies can add a million customers at a click of a button or by merely releasing a few lines of code  That means they can grow into the P   price   while expanding the E   earnings 
What s more  they can do that no matter who s in the White House  no matter who s in Congress  no matter whether Wall Street is muzzled or not  That  in turn  means they re scaleable and potentially worth hundreds of billions of dollars more than they are today 
That s what most investors are missing 
They re so concerned with judging specific stocks by specific metrics that they fail to take in consideration the very real possibility that they may not apply in today s markets 
Let me give you another example that ll help put this in context 
Take a car maker   any car maker 
They make a four wheeled contraption that hasn t changed since Karl Benz introduced his horseless carriage in 1885   132 years ago  What they sell is limited by what they produce  so the PE ratio  which measures a given stock s price in relation to its earnings  still applies 
You can argue that they can boost revenue by fancy financing  changing their R D  or even reducing expenses  I would argue that  at the end of the day  they re still limited by the number of cars they can produce and sell to a finite customer base 
Remember  PE ratios don t account for growth  nor do they reflect the quality of earnings 
Many public companies can manipulate earnings  and do  in pursuit of higher stock prices  For instance  many publicly traded manufacturing companies boost their earnings by boosting their accounts receivable and counting them as  sales   even though there has been no value created and no related cash flow 
What matters   and what I want you to understand   is that most investors fear buying something that s expensive because they cannot justify it using metrics that are based on the past  and instead of reconciling why that may not be the best course of action  they give up 
Perma bears don t help 
Every time the markets hit new highs  they come out to offer sage commentary and all sorts of rational for their thinking  which usually comes down to some variation of  it s expensive   The unwritten implication  of course  is that the markets are ripe for a fall and you d be a fool not to listen 
Nouriel Roubini started calling for a massive market crash in 2005  and he got one  three years later  which means he missed the run up  And the correction  and another run up 
You may recall the name Howard Ruff  He wrote a best seller called  How to Prosper During the Coming Bad Years  and published it in 1979  right before one of the biggest bull runs in history  Ironically  he surfaced again in February 2009 with alarmingly bearish commentary  exactly one month before the markets began a legendary triple digit run up 
Now there s a new raft of folks cautioning against new highs merely because they fear new lows  and  of course  because stocks are  expensive   Only thing is  truly great stocks like the fabulous five are never expensive because they grow into earnings 
More to the point  the best stocks are always making new highs  which is why you want to be constantly investing in them  That s how they work and how you make money 
People tell me all the time that this is a loaded statement  and they re right   it is   for the simple reason that even the gut wrenching lows of 2003 and early 2009 were all time highs when compared to the very same markets in 1990 or in 1980 
It s your perspective that changes 
Remember   the best companies never go out of style  and neither do the profits they create in your bank account "
"The Zacks  industry primarily comprises metal processing and fabrication services providers  These companies are engaged in the conversion  manufacturing and fabrication of metal into end products  Important fabricated metal processes include forging  stamping  bending  forming  and machining which are used to shape individual pieces of metal while other processes  such as welding and assembling are used to join separate parts together  The products are utilized in a variety of applications across a gamut of markets  including construction  mining  aerospace and defense  automotive  agriculture  oil and gas  electronics electrical components  industrial equipment and general consumer markets  Let s take a look at the three major themes currently governing the industry The largest material purchases for the industry are resins  steel  aluminum  copper  other metals and energy  electricity  natural gas and fuel   Of late  higher material costs  primarily related to oil and metal based commodities have been hurting the industry  Costs escalated as a result of imposition of tariffs  Nevertheless  some players in the industry have been successful in mitigating cost inflation through price hikes  resourcing to alternate suppliers to secure better pricing or avoid import and transportation costs  However  these measures take time and it might not be always feasible to pass on higher costs to customers  given the competitive environment  This in turn could adversely impact industry s margins  In addition  finding skilled labor is becoming increasingly difficult with the industry steadily embracing technology  The latest  of the Federal Reserve revealed that aggregate production of fabricated metal products in the United States logged growth of 3 8  in the third quarter of 2018  Overall production has gone up 4 5  in the 12 month ended November 2018  Further  per the Institute for Supply Management s latest   fabricated metal products reported growth in December aided by improvement in new orders  production  employment levels and backlog  This upbeat performance despite cost inflation and supply chain challenges that the Metal Products   Procurement And Fabrication industry is currently facing  indicate it is on a firm footing  With the wide range of markets served  the Metal Products   Procurement And Fabrication industry s prospects are closely aligned with that of the economy  In the United States  business investment is likely to expand supported by favorable financial conditions and an improving regulatory climate  Developing countries particularly hold promise on account of rapid industrialization auguring well for demand  Further  the industry s customer focused approach to provide cost effective technical solutions  automation to increase efficiency and lower labor costs  development of new products and innovative products will help sustain growth  According to a report published by Transparency Market Research  the global metal fabrication market was valued at around  17 Billion in 2017 and is anticipated to expand at a CAGR of over 3  from 2018 to 2026  Growth will likely be spurred by the construction segment followed by the automotive segment  Zacks Industry Rank Indicates Dismal Prospects The group s   which is basically the average of the Zacks Rank of all the member stocks  indicates gloomy prospects in the near term  The Metal Products   Procurement And Fabrication industry  which is a 14 stock group within the broader  Sector  currently carries a Zacks Industry Rank  206  which places it at the bottom 20  of 256 Zacks industries  Our research shows that the top 50  of the Zacks ranked industries outperforms the bottom 50  by a factor of more than 2 to 1  The industry s positioning in the bottom 50  of the Zacks ranked industries is a result of negative earnings outlook for the constituent companies in aggregate  Looking at the aggregate earnings estimate revisions  it appears that analysts are gradually losing confidence in this group s earnings growth potential  Since the end of the third quarter  the industry s earnings estimate for the current year has gone down 5   Despite the bleak near term prospects of the industry  we will present a few Metal Products   Procurement And Fabrication that one can retain given their growth prospects  But it s worth taking a look at the

Long term government debt yields came in below short term bills on Jun 3  While  yields on 3 month U S  Treasury Bill remained flat at 2 349   the yield on 10 year U S  Treasury Note plunged to 2 062   its lowest since September 2017  This resulted in further widening of inversion in the yield curve As a matter of fact  the yield curve inversion between 3 month Treasury bill and the 10 year Treasury note increased to its highest levels since the financial crisis Per reports on Jun 4  the U S  government is looking to step up investigations against four major American tech companies  The probe is related to concerns about antitrust violations as well as reportedly dubious business practices of these major tech behemoths Moreover  there have been reports that the U S  Justice Department could launch a probe against both Amazon   NASDAQ AMZN   and Apple   NASDAQ AAPL    related to business malpractices  Facebook   NASDAQ FB   too is likely to be probed on similar charges by a team from the Federal Trade Commission Under such jittery conditions  mutual funds that are likely to offer healthy returns along with a lower level of risk are popular choices  But to identify funds that can offer such features  one should find out a way of measuring a fund s risk adjusted return  This is where the Sharpe ratio comes into play  Created by Nobel laureate William F  Sharpe  the Sharpe ratio is one of the popular ways of measuring funds  performances on the basis of risk adjusted return  A fund with a higher Sharpe ratio is believed to be more attractive than one with a lower ratio What Does Sharpe Ratio Mean for Mutual Funds The Sharpe ratio of a mutual fund measures its average return relative to the level of volatility the fund experiences  It indicates the value that a fund delivers for the risk it poses  in other words  its risk adjusted return  The numerator of the ratio consists of a fund s mean return over a given time period subtracted by the return of a risk free investment over the same period  say U S  government Treasury bonds or bills  Meanwhile  its denominator comprises standard deviation of a fund s return  which measures the level of fluctuation of returns  over the same time frame So  Sharpe Ratio    Average Return   Risk Free Return  Standard DeviationThis ratio indicates how much extra return one can derive from a portfolio by taking additional risk  It is generally speculated that Sharpe ratio calculated over a three year or longer period of time should be considered while assessing the performance of a fund in terms of risk adjusted return  We have already seen that the higher the Sharpe ratio  the more will be the fund s attractiveness among risk averse investors  Moreover  most investors think mutual funds with a Sharpe ratio higher than 1 are good investment options 4 Best ChoicesWe have  thus  selected four mutual funds carrying a Zacks Mutual Fund Rank  1  Strong Buy  or 2  Buy  that are poised to gain from such factors  Moreover  these funds have encouraging one and three year returns  Additionally  the minimum initial investment is within  5000 and each of these funds has a three year Sharpe ratio which is greater than 1 We expect these funds to outperform their peers in the future  Remember  the goal of the Zacks Mutual Fund Rank is to guide investors to identify potential winners and losers  Unlike most of the fund rating systems  the Zacks Mutual Fund Rank is not just focused on past performance  but also on the likely future success of the fund The question here is  why should investors consider mutual funds  Reduced transaction costs and diversification of portfolio without several commission charges that are associated with stock purchases are primarily why one should be parking

"For Immediate Release 

Chicago  IL   June 01  2016   Zacks com announces the list of stocks featured in the Analyst Blog  Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets  Stocks recently featured in the blog include   Alphabet  NASDAQ GOOGL      Oracle  NYSE ORCL      Yahoo  NASDAQ YHOO      Apple  NASDAQ AAPL     and Microsoft  NASDAQ MSFT      

Today  Zacks is promoting its   Buy   stock recommendations   

Here are highlights from Tuesday s Analyst Blog  

Technology Stock Roundup

Last week  the jury gave Alphabet    a long awaited win against Oracle    even as AT T  NYSE T  started bidding for Yahoo    and Apple     stores in India suffered a slight setback 

Here are the top stories 

Google Wins in Court

Google and Oracle have been fighting it out for six years over Google s use of Java application programming interfaces  APIs  in Android  At first  the judge ruled that Java APIs could not be patented  a decision that was overturned on appeal with the case sent for retrial  The re trial between Google and Oracle took about three weeks after which a jury of 10 unanimously voted that Google s dependence on Java APIs was fair use under law  As expected  Oracle said it would appeal 

The question of APIs is highly sensitive because on the one hand  software developers can t build anything useful if they can t  without qualification  rely on another developer s software stack  Interoperability is a must because discrete systems aren t useful for consumers  On the other hand  companies building software need to be able to protect and commercialize their work in order to raise the funds for further development 

In this case  it was ruled that Google s was  fair use   The fact that the 11K lines copied amounted to just 0 0009  of Android helped  Google also pointed out that Oracle hadn t borne the risk and cost of creating and marketing Android  which is very different from the Java code used  It also said that Sun Microsystems  which owned Java at the time  was happy with Google s use of Java and didn t ask for licensing fees  There was no mention of Sun s financial difficulties at the time  which made it impossible to get into legal duel with Google and forced it to sell out to Oracle  However  Oracle did exhibit emails wherein Google executives admitted that the inability to acquire the license from Sun could lead to legal trouble in the future 

The use of APIs should probably not be deemed unfair unless such use makes it difficult for the owner to survive  For instance  if a Java based OS couldn t survive in the market simply because of Android s clout and ecosystem or Google s willful attempt to stifle it  amounting to Google s attempt to destroy the source from which Android emerged   this would be unfair and Google should then be called on to pay up 

Even AT T Wants Yahoo Now

Yahoo shares were highly volatile last week as news of the core selling for just  2 3 billion were made light of by CFO Ken Goldman  The CFO indicated that such  leaks  in the press should only be expected at this stage of the talks  which were progressing extremely well 

Later  there were reports that AT T had entered the bidding war after the digital advertising company YP Holdings  in which it has a stake  withdrew  With the next round of bidding about to commence this week  it has been reported that Verizon remains the front runner and Microsoft      along with some private equity firms also remains in the race 

India Stores Won t Be Easy for Apple

Apple has high hopes for India and the CEO has done his bit visiting temples  fraternizing with film stars and meeting with the Prime Minister  These moves didn t soften the government s position on Apple retail stores in India  According to Indian law  total foreign ownership of a single brand retail store is possible only when 30  of inputs are sourced from within the country 

It was initially thought that the waiver for companies offering  cutting edge technology  would apply to Apple  But Apple s application on these grounds was rejected by the Finance Ministry  Other smartphone makers  local and foreign  also objected to Apple s plans of selling refurbished iPhones saying it would hurt competition  Brand retailers like Apple offer  empty calories   i e   they sell products that bring limited benefit to the economy  So the government may not allow them 

But all hope isn t lost because the Commerce Ministry hasn t objected to Apple s stores and may take up the matter with the Finance Ministry  Further  Apple also has a Plan B  its manufacturers Foxconn and Pegatron are reportedly looking to manufacture in India  Apple may also be able to sweeten the deal given the two software development centers recently inaugurated in Bangalore and Hyderabad 

That said  there is no ban on selling iPhones in India  What Apple wants is to set up stores that will help to build the brand and this is where the problem appears to lie  So even if there are no Apple stores in the country right away  iPhone sales in India will likely continue to grow from the 50   rate in the last quarter

"Verizon Communications Inc   NYSE VZ  and AT T Inc   NYSE T   wireless industry competitors with diverging business strategies  are among the first major companies in the newly formed Communication Services sector to report this quarter  Investors will see if their revenue gets an expected boost  perhaps from the improving consumer scene 
VZ and T are the two largest wireless carriers in the U S  by subscribers  and both companies stocks struggled after their previous quarterly reports  VZ is scheduled to report its earnings before the opening bell Tuesday  April 23  and T reports before the bell on Wednesday  April 24 
The Communication Services sector was created just a few quarters ago  combining companies that were in Info Tech and Consumer Discretionary with those from the old Telecom sector  With the mass amount of consumers in nearly nonstop contact with communications devices  companies here like VZ and T might consider the thriving consumer as a good sign for their bottom line  And a stronger than expected U S  jobs report in March  which revealed the healthiest jobs scene in nearly 50 years  might help reassure investors about consumer confidence 
By some third party analyst projections  the Communications Services sector is expected to lead all sectors in revenue growth this quarter  although the earnings expectations aren t so rosy  Wall Street expectations for T  specifically  fit that bill  but the forecast for VZ is more muted 
Both companies shares had a positive start to the year  but in the second quarter that changed  Year to date  VZ shares were up 2 3  as of April 18  with momentum slowing the past month  while T shares were up 11 9  on a steady rally 
T is expected to report adjusted EPS of  0 86  up a smidge from  0 85 in the prior year quarter  according to third party consensus analyst estimates  Revenue is projected at  45 1 billion  up 18 6  from a year ago 
VZ is expected to report adjusted EPS of  1 17  on par with the prior year quarter  according to third party consensus analyst estimates  Revenue is projected at  32 2 billion  also about flat from a year ago 
 FIGURE 1  CHOPPY TELECOMS  Telecom companies  including Verizon  VZ   candlestick  and AT T  T   purple line  have seen a good deal of up and down movement since last fall  Though some analysts expect healthy growth in the Communications Services sector as a whole  whether such growth might extend to these two companies remains to be seen  Chart source  The thinkorswim  platform from TD Ameritrade  For illustrative purposes only  Past performance does not guarantee future results  
Verizon Steps Up in Streaming Market
Recently  VZ started to roll out its 5G network in Chicago and Minneapolis  kicking off the era of super speed  which could have an impact on nearly every corner of the Communications Services sector  Its planning to launch the 5G network in 30 major cities this year  For consumers who can tap into it  5G can offer speeds of about 10 times faster than they might normally get  however CEO Hans Vestburg cautioned that the company will not likely see revenue from 5G upgrades until 2020 
The rollout is so far largely symbolic because most consumers don t have the Motorola  NYSE MSI  phone for the clip on modem that will upgrade the service  nor is the infrastructure build out completed  However it offers potential for revenue growth for a number of companies in the communications sector besides VZ  including T 
Meanwhile  VZ has also been trying to find a sweet spot in pricing  It increased the in store cost to upgrade or activate its phones to  40 from  30  citing the fact that consumers get a  full service experience  there  In tandem  the cost for upgrades made online  which would be cheaper for the company  have been reduced to  20 from  30 for the consumer 
Last quarter  VZ s revenue missed Wall Street estimates and its quarterly profit was flat  Shares slid 3  in premarket trade  Still  VZ added nearly twice the number of new wireless subscribers that third party analysts expected 
Verizon Options
For VZ  options traders have priced in a 2 8    1 62  stock move in either direction around the coming earnings release  according to the Market Maker Move  indicator on the thinkorswim  platform 
Put options have been active at the weekly 59  60  and 58 strikes  while call option activity has been heaviest at the 58 strikes  Implied volatility was at the 24th percentile as of this morning 
Note  Call options represent the right  but not the obligation  to buy the underlying security at a predetermined price over a set period of time  Put options represent the right  but not the obligation  to sell the underlying security at a predetermined price over a set period of time 
AT T Keeps Entertainment Focus
With the start of the next generation of internet connectivity led by VZ s 5G rollout  T seems to be remain focused on entertainment endeavors  Remember  last year T acquired media giant Time Warner for  85 billion  which gave it a bank of content 
Now  competition in the media and entertainment market is heating up  especially in streaming  where T has said it wants to launch a more robust streaming service anchored by HBO at a  compelling price point  by the end of the year  That will have to contend with the influx of new streaming offering from major players like Disney  DIS  and Apple  NASDAQ AAPL  
T s debt load  which many analysts say is significantly high  is also likely to continue to be on investors  radars again this quarter  It held  171 billion in debt at the end of last quarter  and investors will soon learn whether its efforts to pare back its debt are having any impact  T has said it will pay down up to  20 billion by the end of this year in part by selling non core assets  which it expects will raise about  8 billion  The wireless giant just sold its minority stake in Hulu  HULU   valued at  1 43 billion  which its using toward debt reduction 
Last quarter  T saw slower wireless subscriber growth than expected with a net gain of 134 000 new subscribers  short of the 208 000 third party analysts were expecting  The DirectTV Now streaming service lost 267 000 members  more than expected and which the company blamed in part on customers leaving after a promotional introductory period  Total revenue was short of third party estimates  and earnings were in line  Its stock slid 4  in the aftermath of the report 
AT T Options
For T  options traders have priced in a 3 3    1 06  stock move in either direction around the coming earnings release  according to the Market Maker Move indicator on the thinkorswim platform 
Put options have been active at the weekly 32  32 5  and 33 strikes  while call option activity has been heaviest at the 30 and 32 strikes  Implied volatility was at the 23rd percentile as of this morning

For Immediate ReleaseChicago  IL   May 1  2018   Today  Zacks Equity Research discusses the Industry  Consumer Staples  Part 3  including Amazon   NASDAQ AMZN    Sysco  NYSE SYY    Colgate   NYSE CL    Campbell Soup   NYSE CPB   and Kimberly Clark   NYSE KMB   Industry  Consumer Staples  Part 3Link  Even though the picture appears rosy for the U S  economy  this favorable economic landscape can divert investors  focus from the defensive consumer staples zone to other seemingly attractive spaces This is likely one of the explanations for the sector s recent underperformance  a trend that can remain in place for quite some time  Stocks in the Zacks Consumer Staples sector are down  4  over the last 12 months  lagging the S P 500 index s  14 2  gain over the same time period Continued Fed tightening and higher interest rates also remain an issue for these stocks  This is so for two reasons  First  Consumer Staples stocks  like Utility stocks  are typically dividend payers which tend to struggle during periods of rising interest rates Second  Consumer Staples companies have global operations and remain vulnerable to strength in the exchange value of the U S  dollar  The dollar has started gaining ground lately on account of the Fed and interest rate backdrop Also  possibility of a trade war with China continues to raise fears for companies whose business operations are likely to be hit by tariffs Other than this  the consumer staples space is grappling with rising input costs as well as intense competition  with the latter stemming from consumers  changing preferences and Amazon s ever growing dominance  This  in turn has created significant pricing pressure  alongside compelling companies to undertake aggressive promotional activities  These factors pose major threats to margins  which have been plateaued for quite some time now That said  we believe that investors must take stock of the possible obstacles in the consumer staples sector before making any investment decision within it Input Cost Volatility  Escalated Freight CostsInput costs play a major role in determining the performance of a company  An increase in input cost directly hits the company s margins and profits  Moreover  any price increase to offset the same may drive consumers away  We note that many Consumer Staples companies are bearing the brunt of high input costs  which remains a concern for the future  Also  the food industry in general is battling a tough transportation landscape due to lower driver availability This  in turn  has raised freight costs for many players like Sysco  among others  In fact  most of these companies expect higher freight costs to remain a threat to their margins Moving to higher commodity costs  consumer goods behemoth Colgate has been bearing the brunt of increased commodity and packaging costs  which have been hurting its gross margin  Input cost inflation also remains a cause of concern for players like Campbell Soup  In fact  Kimberly Clark expects commodity costs to shoot up mainly due to higher prices for several raw materials  including pulp  As for Church   Dwight  it expects both higher commodity and transportation expenses to weigh on gross margin in 2018  Sysco and Pinnacle Foods are other examples that remain troubled by both these headwinds Intense CompetitionConsumer staples companies face stiff competition with respect to innovation  pricing  brand strength  promotions and responsiveness to evolving consumer trends  This results in lower pricing power and a decline in market share  which in turn compresses margins and earnings  For example  Kimberly Clark s diaper segment faces significant competitive activity  which puts the company s market share at risk Dean Foods also battles stiff competition  not only with various dairy processors for shelf space  but also with various beverages and nutritional products Strained MarginsMany companies in the consumer staples sector have been plagued by strained margins  stemming from various factors  These include tough grocery market conditions  rising input costs  costs associated with meeting consumers  changing demands and stiff competition that leads to aggressive promotions and price wars  From food companies to cosmetic firms to consumer products companies  all remain troubled by squeezed margins The grocery industry has been grappling with challenges like stiff competition and aggressive promotions  which became more pronounced after Amazon s takeover of Whole Foods Market  NASDAQ WFM   Traditional grocery companies are facing competition from rivals  which are strengthening their franchises and offering alternative outlets for food and other staples  Also  customers are more inclined toward private label products  which are low cost alternatives to national brands  This  in turn  is hurting food companies Higher Operating Expenses to Limit ProfitsAs demand for staples is usually consistent  companies strive to increase sales and market share through innovations  promotions and efficient marketing and advertising  Thus  consumer staple companies tend to spend heavily on marketing and advertising Though advertising strengthens brand appeal and helps to counter competition  it severely hits the profit margins of these companies  Also  efforts to keep up with consumers  changing needs entail significant costs  In this regard  costs related to e commerce development and marketing are likely to impact profitability Emerging Market VolatilityThe majority of the global population is clustered in emerging economies  Thus  food beverage companies are increasingly investing in developing and emerging markets like India  China and Brazil which boast significant growth potential due to relatively low per capita consumption  Another reason is the burgeoning middle class population with rising income levels  which in turn is increasing the demand for convenience food and beverages Though emerging markets offer strong growth prospects  they are generally volatile due to fluctuating currencies and other structural and political issues  Moreover  any unprecedented event that may impact economic conditions in countries like China  Brazil and Russia remains a threat Bottom LineThough the consumer staples industry is faced with a number of problems  does the sector have anything to offer to short term investors Check out our latest  for more on the current state of affairs in this market from an earnings perspective and the trend in this important sector of the economy More

"Declining revenue for a second straight quarter  in an increasingly competitive cloud computing environment could loom for Technology firm Oracle  NYSE ORCL  as it prepares to report Wednesday 
Most analysts expect a year over year revenue dip  although they also expect earnings per share  EPS  to rise in the company s fiscal Q4 when the company shares results after Wednesday s market close  Guidance is likely to also get a close look  with the company saying last quarter that it expects double digit EPS growth during the fiscal year 
Over the last year or two  we ve often seen companies that report lower revenue get hurt a bit in the market  That means investors might want to consider checking closely to see if ORCL had a corresponding cut in expenses during the quarter  Or  if expenses grew  can the company really justify that growth 
A stronger dollar and growing competition in the cloud space might be two of the big reasons ORCL s revenue could come under pressure  analysts say  In addition  some analysts believe cloud growth might be decelerating  More companies are coming into cloud computing  so everyone is looking to keep their margins and do things that make sense  so to speak 
Competition Bringing Rivals Together 
For instance  as competition ramps up in the cloud space  companies are starting to work together to improve service  ORCL announced recently it would partner with Microsoft  NASDAQ MSFT  to migrate and run  mission critical enterprise workloads  across Microsoft Azure and Oracle Cloud 
 With this partnership  our joint customers can migrate their entire set of existing applications to the cloud without having to re architect anything  preserving the large investments they have already made   ORCL said in a press release 
Competition in the cloud space could come to a head as soon as next month  when the Pentagon is expected to award a 10 year   10 billion cloud services contract  Companies including ORCL  Amazon  NASDAQ AMZN   and MSFT are battling for what s known as Joint Enterprise Defense Infrastructure  or JEDI  The Federal government s cloud spending is  8 9 billion a year and growing rapidly  CNN reported last week 
It might be interesting to see if ORCL gives any update about when it expects the government to make its decision 
Another thing to consider looking for is what ORCL s leaders say not just about competition in the cloud  but the global economy and trade  During the recent earnings season  more than 100 companies mentioned  tariffs  during their earnings conference calls  according to FactSet  It s possible that ORCL  with its businesses spread across so much of the globe  might have something to say in its call about possible tariff impacts on its business and the world economy  The strong dollar and its impact could be another topic 
Also  consider paying close attention to ORCL s projections  That goes beyond what it says about next quarter and full year guidance  What might be more important is what executives think about the industry moving ahead  Investors might want to keep their ears open for any sense executives provide of how growing cloud competition is affecting the space  and whether slower economic growth in Europe and Asia might have an impact on demand 
As of mid June  ORCL shares were up nearly 19  year to date  compared with about a 15  rise for the S P 500 Index  SPX   In the past 52 weeks  the stock is up 11  
ORCL is expected to report earnings per share of  1 07  from  0 99 in the prior year period  on revenue of  10 95 billion  according to third party consensus analyst estimates  Revenue is projected to be down about 2 7  year over year 
In fiscal Q3  ORCL s earnings of  0 87 per share exceeded the average analyst estimate of  0 84 per share  and revenue and guidance were both in line with Wall Street s estimates  Shares fell 4  immediately after company reported  perhaps in part because year over year revenue dropped 1   though on a constant currency basis  quarterly revenue rose 3   the company said  
Stock Outpacing Overall Market in 2019
ORCL shares stumbled with the rest of the stock market and Technology sector in May  but rebounded in June  The stock is up 6 3  since June 3  outpacing the broader market  It s possible ORCL shares might face some resistance up around  54 to  54 15  During the recent market sell off  shares fell briefly below  50 intraday in late May   See figure 1 below  

FIGURE 1  DIP AND REBOUND  Shares of ORCL fell along with the rest of the market in May 2019  falling below  50 at one point  but shares rebounded quickly in June  Data source  Nasdaq  Chart source  The thinkorswim  platform from TD Ameritrade  For illustrative purposes only  Past performance does not guarantee future results 
Oracle s Fusion HCM  ERP  Supply Chain and Manufacturing Cloud applications revenue grew 32  in fiscal Q3  the company said  NetSuite ERP Cloud applications revenue grew 30  during that quarter  However  ORCL faces intense competition as other players shift to cloud computing 
For instance  earlier this month Alphabet  GOOG  NASDAQ GOOGL   announced a deal to acquire Looker  a business intelligence software and big  data analytics platform  for  2 6 billion in cash  This purchase  The Wall Street Journal reported  could bolster GOOGL s cloud computing business  where it s trailed rivals 
And earlier this year  Nvidia  NVDA  announced the purchase of Mellanox  MLNX   a maker of Ethernet switches and adapters that connect computers to each other  This is a move analysts said could give NVDA  a chipmaker  a foothold in the cloud space 
Competition is likely to keep increasing  but ORCL as a mature company in the space  has a head start in some ways because of its huge sales and distribution network 
Software as a Service  SaaS  which allows users to subscribe and use application software in the cloud is an area where ORCL has a heavy presence  One reason the stock might be doing so well is that within 10 years analysts expect the overall SaaS business  for ORCL and competitors  to grow six fold  It s a high margin business already  and many analysts expect those margins to increase 
Also  the hardware business is still nearly 10  of ORCL s revenues  While some analysts note that hardware might weigh on ORCL s operating margins  companies like Apple  NASDAQ AAPL  have shown that hardware can be a robust business area  There s still a place for it  but companies like ORCL have to allocate resources smartly 
Oracle Options Activity
For ORCL  the options market has priced in an expected share price move of about 4 6  in either direction around the earnings release  according to the Market Maker Move  indicator on the thinkorswim  platform 
Put activity has been highest at the 52 5 and 50 strikes  but higher volume overall has been on the call side  most notably at the weekly 55 strike  The implied volatility sits at the 52nd percentile  right above the middle of the range

" Friday Market Open  Investors appear to keep readjusting their expectations for stock market valuations after two market leading stocks came up short of expectations 
Like last quarter  investors may shrug at positive earnings reports  but any disappointments can mean that shares might get hammered  It s that latter scenario that seems to be happening this morning as shares of Amazon  NASDAQ AMZN  and Alphabet  NASDAQ GOOG  GOOGL  are under pressure and appear to be leading broader sentiment lower 
Although both companies reported better earnings per share than Wall Street analysts had expected  they also both missed quarterly revenue projections  AMZN s holiday quarter guidance also appeared to disappoint investors 
Both companies  shares were down sharply in pre market trading  Shares of other members of the so called FAANG stocks Facebook  NASDAQ FB   Netflix  NASDAQ NFLX  and Apple  NASDAQ AAPL  were also down 
It could be worth keeping in mind that the FAANG stocks had all rallied Thursday amid an upbeat day for U S  equities as October volatility continued  Over the last two turbulent weeks  this group of stocks seems to have been a leader to the upside as well as the downside 
One bright spot this morning came on the economic data front  The government s first estimate of gross domestic product came in at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 3 5   slightly ahead of the Briefing com consensus estimate forecasting 3 3  growth 
Volatility And Discipline
If there was ever a time to consider staying disciplined with your investing or trading strategy  times like these may be it 
If you re an active trader  you might have been loving the volatility we ve been seeing this month  After all  some strategies can help you protect your assets  or even make money  during a down market  For longer term investors  the volatility can be scary  but a disciplined focus can help  Also  even beyond this extra volatile October  ups and downs in the stock market are normal  Over time  buy and hold investors tend to see the ups and downs smooth out   See more on volatility below  
That said  now appears to be a special time for the market  Market participants seem to be trying to figure out where they want to be positioned to close out 2018 and begin the new year 
That factor alone could cause some volatility  but the reallocation is also coming as investors re think the valuation of tech stocks  consider what rising interest rates may mean for the market  weigh geopolitical developments and continue to watch closely for news on trade negotiations between the United States and China  And this year  we ve got midterm U S  elections thrown into the mix 
Perhaps it s no wonder the market is choppy 
Considering Your Own Outlook
One thing that may help calm some nerves for those who might be a bit jittery is to sit back and consider what your long term belief is about where the individual companies or sectors you may be invested in are going  Coupling that with what CEOs are saying about their views for the coming three to six months could offer a broader picture than just focusing on the day to day headlines and market ups and downs 
While rising interest rates on government debt  which appeared to be the match that started this volatility fire a couple weeks ago  can mean that there is more competition now for stocks such as utilities  the rising rates don t mean that the market as a whole has to sink  That s especially true now as a strong economy appears to be a key reason that interest rates are rising 
Bullion And The Buck
Amid all this volatility  now might be a good time to check in on the performance of a couple of investments besides U S  Treasuries that are often considered to be safe havens  First  the U S  dollar has been performing well along with the U S  economy and as some foreign jurisdictions don t look as enticing as the United States 
Meanwhile  gold has seen a pop despite the rising dollar  The two assets tend to move inversely with one another  so the fact that gold has been on the rise argues that investors could be using the precious metal to hedge some uncertainty  Still  gold is well off its highs this year  so the increase in market volatility may be acting as an excuse for some bargain hunting 

FIGURE 1 VOLATILITY NOT UNPRECEDENTED  Though this month s volatility might feel particularly intense  it s worth noting that such periods aren t too uncommon  Looking back 20 years in the Cboe Volatility Index  VIX   we see several extended periods in the mid 20s The red line is drawn at a VIX reading of 25  Data Source  Cboe Global Markets  Chart source  The thinkorswim  platform from TD Ameritrade  For illustrative purposes only  Past performance does not guarantee future results 
A Market Reboot  Beyond the normal October trading choppiness  it appears that there is some normalization going on in the market  As traders and investors look to the latter part of this year and into next  it seems that some are re evaluating stock valuations  Perhaps that shouldn t be surprising as we ve seen interest rates moving up toward more historically normal levels after a prolonged stint at artificially low levels  Also  consider the CBOE Volatility Index  VIX   The market s main fear gauge has surged this month amid worries about higher interest rates  trade and geopolitics  But glancing at a chart back to the 1990s shows that the VIX s level around 24 as of Thursday afternoon isn t out of line with many historical moves  see figure 1 above  
Bull Market Seen Slowing  Not Stopping  Just because investors are apparently reassessing their stock market exposure  doesn t mean the bull market is over   We think the S P 500 will be higher a year from now  though its angle of ascent is being adjusted to a more sustainable trajectory  since GDP and EPS growth should face tougher comparisons in the quarters ahead   said investment research firm CFRA  referring to earnings per share and gross domestic product growth  That doesn t mean investors aren t questioning the strength of the bull market  the note said  First  stocks have dropped substantially over the past two weeks  leading to questions about company earnings growth fundamentals and to the search for bottoming technical patterns  It still probably is worth bearing in mind that October is a notoriously volatile month 
Weekly Unemployment Snapshot  While economic reports like this morning s GDP report and look forward to next week s nonfarm payrolls data  both are often closely followed by investors and analysts  while other economic reports don t seem to get as much glory  Take claims for unemployment benefits  This weekly report is often right up there with natural gas inventories in the 2nd tier department  But over time  the jobless numbers help form an important view of the labor market in between the government s monthly report on the employment situation  The latest four week moving average for continuing claims showed the lowest level since August 1973  The data show that the labor market tightness has continued as the economy chugs along  We ll have to wait until next week to get the Labor Department s latest take on the nonfarm payrolls picture  the unemployment rate and hourly wages

economic slowdown and higher supply    especially from the United States    subdued crude oil prices for a month and a half  a turnaround showed up last week on heightened geopolitical conflict with Iran Disturbances in Iran intensified on Jun 13  when two oil tankers were set on fire in the Strait of Hormuz  for which the United States blamed Tehran  On Jun 20  Iran s Revolutionary Guard claimed that it recently shot down a U S  drone near the Strait of Hormuz  Iran alleged that the drone had entered its sky  which the U S  military claimed as international airspace On Jun 21  President Donald Trump tweeted  Iran made a very big mistake   although the United States refrained from conducting military strike on Iran  Trump said that the United States would impose  major additional sanctions  against Iran on Jun 24  Notably  Iran is already facing U S  sanctions regarding crude oil exports after the Trump administration withdrew from Iran Nuclear Agreement of 2015   Crude Oil Prices JumpOn Jun 21  the U S  benchmark West Texas Intermediate  WTI  crude gained 0 6  to settle at  57 43 a barrel  Global benchmark Brent Crude was up 1 1  to settle at  65 14 a barrel  The WTI crude jumped more than 9  in the past week  marking its largest weekly gain since December 2016  The Brent recorded the first weekly gain after five weeks Iran Conflict Likely to Escalate FurtherThe intensifying friction between the two countries could disrupt the shipment of crude through the Strait of Hormuz  responsible for the passage of 20  of total crude oil being consumed globally  per media reports  Through the strait  the majority of the crude volumes of countries like Kuwait  UAE  Iraq and Saudi Arabia are exported It goes without saying that while the Saudis and the United States are on one side  the Houthi Yemenis and Iran make the other  Iran has reportedly warned that if its economy is hit due to America s sanction on its crude export  it will then attempt to disrupt the passage of oil tankers through the strait  This could further constrain global oil supply  The news in fact has already bumped up oil prices    Read More   Global Demand for Crude Oil Remains FirmOn Mar 11  the IEA projected that global crude oil demand will remain firm at least up to 2024 although the rate of demand growth will decline  By this time  demand for oil will rise by 7 1 million bpd Despite a surge in sales of electric cars and massive oil exploration in the United States  demand for oil is expected to rise in the petrochemical industry  especially in the plastic industry  Also  growing demand for aviation oil will support crude oil prices Moreover  geopolitical conflicts in major oil exporting countries like Iran  Venezuela and Libya will push crude oil prices to a great extent  Several industry watchers have estimated that more sanction on oil supply from Iran may witness crude oil price to touch even  100 per barrel Our Top PicksCrude oil prices

"It s report card time 
Roughly 1 100 companies have reported third quarter earnings 
The data  so far  suggest that the market has reached the upper limit on prices 
Companies that miss analysts  expectations are down 3 3  in the two days following the earnings announcement  Such a two day decline is over a full percentage point more than the historical norm 
The reverse is happening  too 
That is  companies beating expectations are up 0 3  in the two days following the earnings announcement  The historic norm is a 1 2  rise in price for companies that  beat  
It s definitely worth keeping an eye on 
Today  though  we re handing out grades 
Who made the honor roll 
Who s being disruptive 
And who just flunked out 
Let s find out 
Honor Roll Goes To
Many people are asking  when will this ripping eight year bull market come to a close 
The answer is much simpler than you think  when earnings stop rising 
Aside from central bank liquidity  no other force in finance has a bigger effect on a stock s price 
But from what we ve seen so far  the earnings growth train isn t stopping   or even slowing down   anytime soon 
According to FactSet  81  of firms in the S P 500 have reported third quarter results  And so far  74  of companies have beaten estimates 
Better still  66  of S P constituents have beaten sales estimates  too 
Plus  with a major U S  corporate tax rate cut on the horizon   which will ultimately boost bottom lines across the board   the sky s the limit for forward profits 
So who made the honor roll this quarter 
Drum roll  please 
The tech sector  with flying colors  
FactSet notes that a whopping 90  of tech names have beaten earnings estimates   and the sector is currently boasting a 19  growth rate from the same period last year 
The FAANG stocks   Facebook  NASDAQ FB   Amazon  NASDAQ AMZN   Apple  NASDAQ AAPL   Netflix  NASDAQ NFLX  and Google  NASDAQ GOOGL    all soared after crushing their third quarter reports 
But the highest honors go to the semiconductor industry 
So far  semis sport an annual third quarter earnings growth rate of 44    the highest of any other tech industry  according to FactSet 
Because their growth has been so strong all year  many of these names are selling off as investors take profits 
If you haven t already loaded up on semi stocks  use the post earnings dips to make your move 
As I ve noted all year  I expect chipmakers to keep on rolling   well into 2018 
The Worst Of The Worst
There were a lot of pretty juicy flunkies this quarter  Perhaps this is a sign that the record low volatility in the market isn t reflecting the real economy 
Let s review some of the worst 
The biggest blooper came from General Electric  NYSE  NYSE GE   Earnings came in at 29 cents per share when the market had been expecting 49 cents 
This sent the stock into a tailspin  Shares sold off 20  as investors worried about the dividend 
Like many big companies  GE has been buying back shares like a maniac in recent years  And with the stock below  20  down nearly 40  this year  that clearly wasn t a smart move 
Another big loser was American International Group  NYSE  NYSE AIG   It lost  1 91 billion in the third quarter  far worse than forecast 
Granted  the hurricanes during the last quarter hit insurance companies hard  Still  the losses were more than double Wall Street s expectations 
Wayfair  NYSE W  was a dud this quarter  too  The stock fell 16  on a loss of 65 cents per share 
It s no surprise that losses were expected this quarter   considering the company always loses money and it s competing directly with Amazon  NASDAQ  AMZN  
Yet somehow the stock is still up 65   And shares will likely recover soon from this quarter s dip as the company s blind acolytes recover their faith 
The award for worst flunkie of the quarter  however  goes to Tesla  NASDAQ TSLA  
The company lost  619 million in the quarter  which was more than expected  And it revealed that it was only able to produce 260 of its  mass market  Model 3 vehicles  A problem in its battery Gigafactory was to blame  which took management a month to identify 
Making matters worse for Tesla  President Trump s new tax plan includes the removal of a key electric car subsidy  according to the IRS 
The stock is down  22 Friday  which created an early Christmas for bearish investors  But Tesla is still up 32  on the year 
Talk about a tribute to the power of positive thinking 
Disruption Is Key
With stocks raging higher for over eight years now  how can investors book the biggest gains at this late stage of the bull market 
Simply invest in companies enjoying the most rapid sales and earnings growth 
Such companies promise to rise the farthest  and longest  because there s obviously some disruptive force at work in their business model that s unlocking the unparalleled growth 
Take Cognex  NASDAQ CGNX   for example 
The company is the world leader in the machine vision industry 
Its systems help customers speed up production  higher efficiency   minimize defects  higher quality  and reduce costs  higher profitability  
What s more  they re increasingly being used in a variety of end markets   including consumer electronics  automotive  consumer products  food and beverage  medical devices  pharmaceuticals  and logistics  package sorting and distribution  
In short  Cognex represents the purest play on one of the fastest growing tech sector trends  robotic automation 
Consider the statistics 
The global industrial robotics market is worth nearly  11 billion today  And it s expected to grow at an annual rate of at least 21  per year 
The Boston Consulting Group predicts that  the share of tasks performed by robots will rise from a global average of around 10  to about 25  across all manufacturing industries  by 2025  It s easy to see why  As BCG notes   An attractive return on investment is possible for replacing manual labor with machines on a wide scale   The savings promise to be substantial  too   as much as 33  in some industries by 2025 
It should be no surprise  then  when you find out that Cognex continues to put up record breaking results  Candidly  I ve never seen a company use more exclamation points in official press releases 
 What a spectacular quarter   exclaimed Dr  Robert J  Shillman  founder and chairman of Cognex  in the release covering the company s third quarter results 
Like I said  this is the norm  not the exception 
In the same quarter a year ago  for instance  Shillman exclaimed   What an outstanding quarter  
It s the norm for Cognex to keep talking about  record  results quarter in  quarter out  too 
Per this quarter s press release   Cognex reported record breaking revenue  net income and earnings per share that far exceeded the prior records set just last quarter  And we were extremely profitable  
A quick glance at the company s stock chart over the last two years tells you all you need to know about the impact of holding a disruptive business in your portfolio  Shares are up a staggering 280   and counting  
To put that into perspective  this single stock delivered more gains in two years  time than you could have generated by investing in the S P 500 for the last 8  years  since the bull market officially began 
The trick  of course  is identifying these companies early  which is precisely what we do every month for True Alpha subscribers 
Yes  Cognex was an official True Alpha recommendation  And it s now a big winner 
Ahead of the tape "

Value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment  After all  who wouldn t want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys  or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios  many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process  Let s put Cullen Frost Bankers  Inc    NYSE CFR   stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value oriented investors right now  or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks PE RatioA key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio  or PE for short  This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock  and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world  The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock s current PE ratio with  a  where this ratio has been in the past  b  how it compares to the average for the industry sector  and c  how it compares to the market as a whole On this front  Cullen Frost Bankers has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 19 48  This level compares favorably with the market at large  as the PE ratio for the S P 500 comes in at about 20 20 If we focus on the long term trend of the stock  the current level puts Cullen Frost Bankers  current PE near its highs over the past five years  suggesting that the stock is somewhat overvalued compared to its own historical levels Further  the stock s PE compares unfavorably with the Zacks classified Banks   Southwest industry s trailing twelve months PE ratio  which stands at 15 64  At the very least  this indicates that the stock is relatively overvalued right now  compared to its peers However  we should point out that Cullen Frost Bankers has a forward PE ratio  price relative to this year s earnings  of 18 02   which is lower than the current figure  So it is fair to say that a slightly more value oriented path may be ahead for Cullen Frost Bankers stock in the near term P CF RatioAn often overlooked ratio that can still be a great indicator of value is the price cash flow metric  This ratio doesn t take amortization and depreciation into account  so can give a more accurate picture of the financial health in a business  This is a preferred metric to some valuation investors because cash flows are  a  generally less prone to manipulation by the company s management and  b  are less affected by variation in accounting policies between different companies The ratio is generally applied to find out whether a company s stock is overpriced or underpriced with reference to its cash flows generation potential compared with its competitors  However  it is not commonly used for cross industry comparison  as the average price to cash flow ratio varies from industry to industry In this case  Cullen Frost Bankers P CF ratio of 13 87 is lower than the Zacks classified Banks   Southwest industry average of 14 14  which indicates that the stock is undervalued in this respect Broad Value OutlookIn aggregate  Cullen Frost Bankers currently has a Zacks Value Style Score of  B   putting it into the top 40  of all stocks we cover from this look  This makes Cullen Frost Bankers an apt choice for value investors  and some of its other key metrics make this pretty clear too For example  the PEG ratio for Cullen Frost Bankers is just 1 90  a level that is lower than the industry average of 1 94  The PEG ratio is a modified PE ratio that takes into account the stock s earnings growth rate Furthermore  the EV EBITDA for Cullen Frost Bankers is just 4 10  much lower than the industry average of 13 66  The EV EBITDA multiple  Enterprise Value  Earnings before Interest Tax Depreciation and Amortization  is capital structure neutral  as it takes into account the level of debt on a company s balance sheet  not just its equity Clearly  CFR is a solid choice on the value front from multiple angles What About the Stock Overall Though Cullen Frost Bankers might be a good choice for value investors  there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name  In particular  it is worth noting that the company has a Growth grade of  D  and a Momentum score of  B   This gives CFR a Zacks VGM score or its overarching fundamental grade of  B    You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores  Our VGM Score identifies stocks that have the most attractive value  growth  and momentum characteristics  and a good VGM score can increase your odds of success  All things considered  Cullen Frost Bankers seems to have pretty striking prospects Meanwhile  the company s recent earnings estimates have been trending upwards lately  The current quarter has seen five estimates go higher in the past thirty days compared to none lower  while the full year estimate has seen four upward revisions versus none in the opposite direction  in the same time period This has had a small impact on the consensus estimate though as the current quarter consensus estimate has remained constant over the past month  while the full year estimate has inched up 0 4   You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action for the stock in the chart below Cullen Frost Bankers  Inc  Price and Consensus   This somewhat favorable trend is why the stock has a Zacks Rank  2  Buy  and why we are looking for better performance from the company in the near term Bottom LineCullen Frost Bankers is an inspired choice for value investors  as it is hard to beat its incredible lineup of statistics on this front  With a formidable industry rank  among the Top 12   and strong Zacks Rank  Cullen Frost Bankers looks like a strong value contender  In fact  over the past year  the Zacks Banks   Southwest industry has clearly outperformed the broader market  as you can see below Moreover  with a further rise in interest rates and improving non interest bearing deposits  the company s net interest income and net interest margin is expected to grow  Additionally  the approval of the Financial Choice Act will support its profitability  Also  Cullen Frost s strong capital position keeps it well poised to continue capital deployment activities  thereby boosting shareholders  confidence So  it might pay for value investors to delve deeper into the company s prospects  as fundamentals indicate that this stock could be a compelling pick More Stock News  This Is Bigger than the iPhone It could become the mother of all technological revolutions  Apple  NASDAQ AAPL  sold a mere 1 billion iPhones in 10 years but a new breakthrough is expected to generate more than 27 billion devices in just 3 years  creating a  1 7 trillion market Zacks has just released a Special Report that spotlights this fast emerging phenomenon and 6 tickers for taking advantage of it  If you don t buy now  you may kick yourself in 2020
