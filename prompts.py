User: Value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment  After all  who wouldn t want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys  or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios  many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process  Let s put PacWest Bancorp   NASDAQ PACW   stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value oriented investors right now  or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks PE RatioA key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio  or PE for short  This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock  and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world  The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock s current PE ratio with  a  where this ratio has been in the past  b  how it compares to the average for the industry sector  and c  how it compares to the market as a whole On this front  PacWest has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 16 75  as you can see in the chart below This level actually compares pretty favorably with the market at large  as the PE for the S P 500 compares in at about 20 15  If we focus on the stock s long term PE trend  the current level puts PacWest s current PE ratio somewhat below its midpoint  which is 17 48  over the past five years Further  the stock s PE also compares favorably with the Zacks classified Banks   West industry s trailing twelve months PE ratio  which stands at 19 26  At the very least  this indicates that the stock is relatively undervalued right now  compared to its peers We should also point out that PacWest has a forward PE ratio  price relative to this year s earnings  of 16 04  so it is fair to say that a slightly more value oriented path may be ahead for PacWest stock in the near term too PEG RatioWhile earnings are certainly important  it is essential to know how much you are paying for the growth of earnings as well  One can easily do that with the PEG ratio  ratio of the P E to the expected future earnings growth rate  The PEG ratio gives a more complete picture of the valuation of a stock than the P E ratio PacWest s PEG ratio stands at just 1 51  compared with the Zacks Banks   West industry average of 1 65  This suggests a decent undervalued trading relative to its earnings growth potential right now Broad Value OutlookIn aggregate  PacWest currently has a Zacks Value Style Score of  B   putting it into the top 40  of all stocks we cover from this look  This makes PACW a solid choice for value investors  and some of its other key metrics make this pretty clear too For example  its P CF ratio  another great indicator of value  comes in at 9 07  which is considerably better than the industry average of 14 85  Clearly  PACW is a solid choice on the value front from multiple angles What About the Stock Overall Though PacWest might be a good choice for value investors  there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name  In particular  it is worth noting that the company has a Growth grade of  D  and a Momentum score of  D   This gives PACW a Zacks VGM score or its overarching fundamental grade of  D    You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores  Meanwhile  the company s recent earnings estimates have been disappointing  The current quarter has seen one estimate go higher in the past sixty days and three lower  while the full year estimate has seen one upward and four downward revisions in the same time period This has had a noticeable impact on the consensus estimate  as the current quarter consensus estimate has fallen by 1 3  in the past two months  while the full year estimate has declined 2 3   You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action for the stock in the chart below PacWest Bancorp Price and Consensus    This bearish trend is why the stock has just a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  and why we are looking for in line performance from the company in the near term Bottom LinePacWest is an inspired choice for value investors  as it is hard to beat its incredible lineup of statistics on this front  However  despite a good industry rank  top 10  out of more than 250 industries   a Zacks Rank  3  makes it hard to get too excited about this company overall  Nonetheless  over the past one year  the Zacks Banks West sector has significantly outperformed the broader market  as you can see below So  value investors might want to wait for estimates and analyst sentiment to turn around in this name first  but once that happens  this stock could be a compelling pick More Stock News  8 Companies Verge on Apple Like RunDid you miss Apple  NASDAQ AAPL  s 9X stock explosion after they launched their iPhone in 2007
